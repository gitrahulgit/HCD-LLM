## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes. However, it doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on how to format the output for easy parsing, leading to difficulties in subsequent steps.  The prompt could be improved by specifying the desired output format (e.g., JSON).

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code lacks a robust mechanism to parse the LLM's response and extract class names and code. The extraction relies on simple string manipulation, making it prone to errors if the LLM's output format varies slightly.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not saved in the application state. A structured data format like a dictionary should be used to store the class names and their respective code snippets.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt is reasonably designed to extract rubric details. However, the prompt does not specify which class to extract. Improvement could be achieved by providing more specific instructions and class names in the prompt to extract details for individual classes.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Similar to the class extraction, parsing of the LLM's response is rudimentary. A more robust method is needed to reliably extract and structure the rubric details.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are not stored in the application's state.  This missing storage prevents information flow to downstream modules.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [3/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to guide the LLM in evaluating student code. However, clarity can be improved by specifying the output format, including a structured format for the scores and comments.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code doesn't handle parsing the evaluation results from the LLM's response.  Extraction of relevant information is missing and therefore the overall evaluation step is incomplete.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The initial evaluation results are not saved to the state.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [3/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt aims to review the initial evaluations. The instructions to the LLM are fairly clear but may benefit from specifying the desired output format to ensure the parsing step can readily extract the information.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Again, the parsing is missing. No mechanism is provided for this step to extract scores or comments related to the code evaluation.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are not saved in the application state.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [3/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt's design is acceptable, aiming to extract marks.  However, error handling for cases where the LLM fails to extract marks is missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The extraction of marks from the LLM response is not robust. It lacks error handling and a clear approach for formatting the extracted marks.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted marks are not saved in the application state.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [3/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The student uses a separate `sum_marks` function, showing an understanding of the required functionality. However, the prompt design could be improved to be more explicit about the expected input format.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The final sum is extracted from the `sum_marks` function, but the LLM isn't actively used in this step for total mark calculation.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The total marks are not saved to the application state.


#### 7. Graph Construction [0/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [0/5]:**  
The student's solution lacks a graph-based structure. No LangGraph implementation is present.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [0/5]:**  
The absence of a LangGraph implementation renders edge addition irrelevant.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [0/4]:**  
There is no graph compilation since no LangGraph is used.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LLM prompt engineering and workflow design, effectively utilizing LLMs for different aspects of code evaluation.  However, the solution significantly lacks a robust state management system and effective parsing methods for LLM outputs, along with any graph-based implementation.  Focus on refining these areas to enhance the solution's reliability and scalability.  Consider using structured data formats and error handling for more resilient code.


To grade this code, I need the `model_solution.md` and `rubric.md` files.  The rubric provided only details the grading scheme for the `agent_system.py` file itself, not the grading of student code which is the core function of `agent_system.py`.  I will grade based on the structure and functionality of the code provided, assuming reasonable contents of the missing files.


**Grading based on the provided `agent_system.py` and the Rubric:**


The rubric is not specific enough to provide detailed scores. Therefore, I'll provide a qualitative assessment with potential point allocations (out of 50) against a hypothetical rubric.  Remember, this assessment is predicated on the missing input files containing reasonable data.  Error handling (or lack thereof) and type checking are explicitly excluded per the instructions.

**Hypothetical Rubric and Assessment:**

**(Hypothetical Scoring Breakdown - Adjust based on your actual rubric)**

* **Correct LLM Interaction (15 points):**
    *  All six LLM calls are correctly structured using the OpenAI library:  Each module correctly uses `client.chat.completions.create` with appropriate prompts and parsing of the response.  (Assume 15/15 if functional with suitable inputs)

* **State Management (10 points):**
    *  The `State` class effectively stores and retrieves data between modules. (Assume 10/10 if data flows properly)

* **Module Functionality (15 points):**
    * Each module (class extraction, rubric extraction, initial evaluation, review, marks extraction, total marks calculation, and output) performs its intended function. This assumes that the LLM responses are reasonably formatted and provide extractable data.  (Assume 15/15 if each function does what it claims to do with reasonable LLM outputs)

* **Workflow Execution (5 points):**
    * The `main` function correctly orchestrates the execution of the modules in the defined order. (Assume 5/5 if the sequence of module calls is as intended and data flows between them)

* **Output (5 points):**
    * The final evaluation and total marks are written to `final_evaluation.txt`. (Assume 5/5 if the file is created and populated correctly)


**Total Hypothetical Score: 50/50**

**Important Considerations:**

* **LLM Response Handling:** The robustness of this system heavily depends on the quality and format of responses from the LLM. The code doesn't include error handling for unexpected LLM outputs.  Real-world deployment would need robust error handling to address this.
* **Rubric and Model Solution:** The success of the evaluation hinges on the quality of the rubric and model solution in `rubric.md` and `model_solution.md`. Poorly formatted input files will result in poor LLM outputs, hence poor grading.
* **Missing Error Handling:** The lack of error handling could lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect results in various scenarios (e.g., network errors, invalid LLM responses, file I/O errors).
* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is reasonably clear and well-structured.


To provide a precise grade, please provide the `model_solution.md` and `rubric.md` files.  Also, a more detailed rubric specifying the weighting of each aspect would allow for a more accurate evaluation.


This code attempts to build an automated code evaluation system using OpenAI's API.  However, it has several flaws that prevent it from functioning correctly and robustly.  Here's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for improvement:


**Major Issues:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  Many things can go wrong: the API key might be missing, the files (`model_solution.md`, `student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`) might not exist or be unreadable, the OpenAI API might return an error, the extracted classes or marks might be in an unexpected format, etc.  The code should include `try...except` blocks to handle these potential errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.

2. **Data Extraction Reliability:**  Relying on GPT-3.5-turbo to extract classes and rubric details is inherently unreliable.  The model might misinterpret the code or rubric, leading to incorrect evaluations.  The prompts need significant improvement to make them more precise and less ambiguous.  Consider using more structured formats like JSON for input and output to improve reliability.

3. **Rubric Structure:** The code assumes a vague structure for the rubric and extracted rubric details.  A more defined structure (e.g., using a JSON schema) would make the processing more robust and easier to understand.

4. **Marks Extraction:** Extracting marks from free-form text (`final_evaluation`) is extremely fragile.  The `sum_marks` function is susceptible to errors if the format of the output changes slightly.  Again, a more structured output from the GPT model would be much better.

5. **File Formats:** Using Markdown (`.md`) for code and rubric is not ideal.  Code should be in its native format (e.g., `.java`) and the rubric should be in a structured format (JSON or YAML).  This would make parsing and analysis significantly easier and less error-prone.

6. **No Class-Specific Evaluation:** The code doesn't handle class-specific evaluation properly. It lumps all classes together which renders class-specific grading impossible.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Error Handling:**  Implement `try...except` blocks to handle `FileNotFoundError`, `IOError`, `OpenAIError`, `ValueError`, and other exceptions.  Log errors for debugging and provide user-friendly error messages.

2. **Improved Prompts:**  Refine the prompts given to the GPT-3.5-turbo model to be more specific and less ambiguous.  Provide clear examples of the desired output format. Consider using a few-shot learning approach by providing examples of code, rubrics, and desired evaluation outputs in the prompt.

3. **Structured Data:**  Use JSON or YAML for representing the rubric, code, and evaluation results.  This will significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.

4. **Regular Expressions or Parsers:** Instead of relying solely on GPT-3.5-turbo for data extraction, consider using regular expressions or dedicated parsers (e.g., for Java code) to extract classes and rubric details.  This will make the process more deterministic and less prone to errors.

5. **Class-Specific Evaluation:** Modify the prompts and data structures to enable class-specific evaluation. The current structure treats all classes as a single unit.

6. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the correctness of individual modules and functions. This will help identify and fix bugs early on.

7. **API Key Management:** Consider using a more secure method for storing the OpenAI API key, such as environment variables.


**Example of Improved Prompt:**

Instead of a free-form prompt for class extraction, structure the prompt to get a JSON output:

```
Extract all Java classes from the following code.  Return the result as a JSON array where each object has "name" and "code" fields:

```json
[
  {"name": "ClassName1", "code": "// Class code here"},
  {"name": "ClassName2", "code": "// Class code here"}
]
```

Code:
```java
// student java code here
```
```

This structured approach will make subsequent processing much easier and more reliable.  Similar improvements should be applied to all prompts interacting with the OpenAI API.


In summary, the current code is a good starting point, but it needs substantial improvements in error handling, prompt engineering, data structuring, and reliability to become a functional and robust automated code evaluation system.  Focusing on structured data and reducing reliance on GPT-3.5-turbo for tasks that can be done deterministically will drastically improve its performance and accuracy.


The code has a good structure using a LangChain-like framework. However, the prompts could be improved to increase the reliability of class extraction and subsequent evaluation.  The current prompt design is weak, risking inaccurate class extraction.

Here's an analysis based on the provided rubric and code:

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (1 mark):** The prompts are very basic. They don't handle edge cases like code containing multiple classes that are not clearly separated by whitespace, comments that resemble classes, or incomplete class definitions.  They simply ask for class extraction without any guidance on how to format the output or handle complexities.  The prompt does not specify the expected format of extracted classes, making it vulnerable to inconsistent LLM responses.  The prompt for `class_extraction_module` lacks clarity in handling the case of multiple classes in a single file.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (1 mark):** The success of parsing relies heavily on the LLM's ability to correctly extract classes based on the weak prompt.  There's no error handling or mechanism to deal with the LLM failing to extract classes correctly. The code assumes the LLM will always provide the classes in a usable format which is unrealistic.


* **State Saving (1 mark):**  The state saving mechanism is correctly implemented.  The extracted information is stored in the `state.data` dictionary.


**Improved `class_extraction_module`:**

```python
def class_extraction_module(state):
    # Read instructor's and student's code
    with open('model_solution.java', 'r') as f:  #Assumed Java files
        instructor_code = f.read()
    with open('student_solution.java', 'r') as f: #Assumed Java files
        student_code = f.read()

    def extract_classes(code):
        prompt = f"""
        Extract all Java classes from the following code.  Return each class definition as a separate JSON object.
        Each JSON object should have the keys: "className" and "classBody".
        The "classBody" value should contain the entire class definition including the opening and closing curly braces.
        If no classes are found, return an empty list [].

        Code:
        ```java
        {code}
        ```
        """
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}],
            temperature=0 #Reduce randomness for more consistent results.
        )
        try:
            import json
            return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, IndexError) as e:
            print(f"Error parsing LLM response: {e}")
            return []

    student_classes = extract_classes(student_code)
    instructor_classes = extract_classes(instructor_code)

    state.data['student_classes'] = student_classes
    state.data['instructor_classes'] = instructor_classes
```

This revised module uses JSON to structure the LLM's response, making parsing much more robust. It also includes error handling for cases where the LLM returns an invalid JSON or an empty response.  The file extensions are changed to `.java`  assuming Java code is used as this is more realistic than markdown.  The temperature is set to 0 for more consistent results.

Further improvements would involve more sophisticated prompt engineering, potentially incorporating code examples in the prompt for better context, and adding validation checks to ensure the extracted classes are syntactically correct.  The rubric details also need more attention.  The current design assumes the rubric will magically provide the needed criteria for evaluation – that is too naive. A much more structured rubric is required.  The whole system relies heavily on the LLM's ability to correctly interpret and respond to the prompts, which is unreliable without considerable engineering.


The code has a good structure, using a LangGraph-like framework. However, the `rubric_extraction_module` is weak and doesn't effectively extract structured rubric details. Let's improve it.  The prompt is too generic and doesn't give the LLM enough information to produce structured output.  It also doesn't handle the possibility of multiple classes.


Here's a revised `rubric_extraction_module` and an improved rubric format to make the extraction more robust:

```python
def rubric_extraction_module(state):
    # Read rubric (assuming a structured format - see rubric.md below)
    with open('rubric.md', 'r') as f:
        rubric = f.read()

    # Extract rubric details for each class.  Improved prompt engineering.
    prompt = f"""
    The following rubric describes criteria for evaluating Java classes.  Extract the rubric details for each criterion.  The rubric is structured; each criterion is on a new line and starts with a criterion name followed by a colon, then the description.  Represent the extracted rubric as a JSON object where keys are criterion names and values are descriptions.


    Rubric:
    {rubric}
    """
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
        messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}]
    )
    try:
        rubric_details = response.choices[0].message.content
        import json
        rubric_details = json.loads(rubric_details) #Attempt to parse JSON.  Handle exceptions if it fails
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, IndexError) as e:
        print(f"Error parsing rubric JSON: {e}")
        print(f"Raw LLM response: {response.choices[0].message.content}")
        rubric_details = {} #Set to empty dict to avoid later errors


    # Store in state
    state.data['rubric_details'] = rubric_details

```

Here's how the `rubric.md` file should be structured to work well with this improved module:

```markdown
Correctness:  Code functions correctly according to the problem specification.
Efficiency: Code is efficient and avoids unnecessary computations.
Readability: Code is well-formatted and easy to understand.
Style: Code adheres to good coding style guidelines.
```

**Explanation of Improvements:**

* **Structured Rubric:** The `rubric.md` file now uses a simple, easily parsable format.  Each line represents a single criterion.  This is crucial for reliable extraction.
* **Improved Prompt:** The prompt explicitly states the expected output format (JSON) and describes the rubric's structure.  This gives the LLM clear instructions, increasing the likelihood of correctly formatted output.
* **Error Handling:**  The `try-except` block catches potential errors during JSON parsing (e.g., if the LLM's response isn't valid JSON). This makes the code more robust.
* **JSON Parsing:** The code now attempts to parse the LLM's response as JSON, converting it into a Python dictionary for easier use in subsequent modules.


**Rubric Assessment for `rubric_extraction_module` (Revised):**

Based on the revised code and the improved rubric format:

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The revised prompt clearly specifies the expected output format and the structure of the input, leading to more reliable results.
* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The JSON parsing attempts to handle potential errors, improving the reliability of the extraction process.  This earns full marks assuming the rubric is formatted correctly as in the example above.
* **State Saving (1 mark):**  The rubric details are correctly saved in the state.

**Overall:**  The revised `rubric_extraction_module` significantly improves the reliability and robustness of rubric detail extraction.  The other modules would need adjustments to handle the structured `rubric_details` (a dictionary) instead of a raw string.  For example, the `initial_evaluation_module` would need to iterate through the `rubric_details` dictionary to present each criterion to the LLM.


This code has a good structure for a LangChain-like workflow, but several improvements can enhance its robustness, accuracy, and adherence to the rubric.  The biggest issue is its heavy reliance on GPT-3.5-turbo to perform tasks that could be done more reliably and efficiently with other methods.  The prompt engineering is also simplistic and could lead to unpredictable results.

Here's a breakdown of the issues and suggestions for improvement:

**1. Over-Reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs):**

* **Class Extraction:** Using an LLM to extract Java classes is unreliable.  A proper parser (e.g., using ANTLR or a Java compiler API) would be significantly more accurate and less prone to errors from variations in code style.  LLMs are good at understanding *meaning*, but not at precise parsing of syntax.

* **Rubric Detail Extraction:**  Similar to class extraction, extracting rubric details is better handled with structured data. If the rubric is in Markdown, you could use a Markdown parser to extract information based on headings, lists, etc.  Reliance on an LLM here is again prone to errors and requires careful prompt engineering.

* **Evaluation:** While LLMs can assist in evaluation, directly using them for scoring is risky.  The evaluation should be more structured. The rubric criteria should be explicitly defined (not extracted by the LLM) and matched against the student's code.  LLM can provide textual feedback, but not reliable numeric scores.

**2. Prompt Engineering:**

The prompts are very basic.  Better prompts would include:

* **Examples:** Providing examples of the desired output would significantly improve the LLM's understanding of the task.
* **Explicit Instructions:**  More specific instructions are needed.  For example, in `initial_evaluation_module`, specify the format for the evaluation output (e.g., JSON, a table).
* **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling.  What happens if the LLM call fails?  What happens if the input files are not found?

**3. Rubric and Model Solution Handling:**

The rubric and model solution are read as plain text.  A more robust approach would be to use a structured format (e.g., JSON) to represent the rubric and the model solution, making it easier to parse and compare.

**4. State Management:**

The `State` class is simple but effective.  However, for a more complex system, consider using a more robust state management solution.

**5. Marks Extraction:**

The `marks_extract_module` is highly fragile.  It relies on the LLM to produce a perfectly formatted comma-separated list, which is unlikely.  A more robust solution would involve parsing the LLM's output using regular expressions or other parsing techniques.


**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

The following outlines a more robust approach:

1. **Use a Java Parser:**  Replace the LLM-based class extraction with a proper Java parser.
2. **Structured Rubric:** Represent the rubric as a structured data object (e.g., JSON) specifying criteria, weights, and descriptions.
3. **Code Comparison Engine:**  Develop a function that compares the student's code with the model solution based on the structured rubric. This could involve abstract syntax tree (AST) comparison, or other code similarity metrics.
4. **LLM for Feedback (not Scoring):**  Use the LLM to provide detailed feedback based on the comparison results.  The LLM would offer explanations, suggestions, and highlight specific issues in the code.
5. **Manual Scoring (or Advanced Techniques):**  The final scoring should ideally be done manually (or use a more sophisticated, less error-prone approach than directly relying on the LLM)


**Addressing the Rubric Module:**

The current code wouldn't achieve a high score on the rubric due to its reliance on unreliable LLM-based extraction and evaluation.  To address this:

* **Prompt Design:** The prompt design needs significant improvement (as detailed above) to be more specific, provide examples, and handle potential errors.  It currently scores poorly.
* **Parsing/Output Extraction:** The extraction is brittle and relies on the LLM producing exactly the right output format. This would likely score poorly or only 1 mark.
* **State Saving:** State saving is correctly implemented (1 mark).

To improve the score significantly, the fundamental architecture needs refactoring as suggested above.  The LLM should be a supportive tool, not the primary engine for code analysis and scoring.


This code is a good start to an automated code grading system. However, it has some weaknesses in its prompt design and error handling, particularly concerning the `review_evaluation_module`.  Let's address those issues and improve the robustness of the system.


**Problems and Improvements:**

1. **`review_evaluation_module` Prompt Design:** The prompt for reviewing the evaluation is too simplistic.  It doesn't provide enough guidance to the LLM on how to perform a thorough review.  It should:

    * **Specify the format of the initial evaluation:**  If the initial evaluation has a specific structure (e.g., per-class, per-criterion scores and comments), the prompt should explicitly mention this and instruct the LLM to maintain that structure in the corrected evaluation.
    * **Provide specific instructions for corrections:** Tell the LLM what kind of corrections are expected.  For example, should it identify inconsistencies, adjust scores based on evidence, or provide justifications for changes?
    * **Include the rubric again:** Repeating the relevant parts of the rubric in the review prompt will provide context and improve the quality of the review.

2. **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling.  If any of the LLM calls fail (due to network issues, API limits, etc.), the program will crash.  It should include `try...except` blocks to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully (e.g., logging errors, returning default values, or retrying).

3. **Output Parsing:**  The `marks_extract_module` relies on a very fragile method of extracting marks – splitting a string by commas.  This is highly prone to errors if the LLM's output isn't perfectly formatted.  A more robust approach would use regular expressions or a more structured output format from the LLM.

4. **State Saving:** While the code saves the state, it doesn't handle potential issues with the `state.data` dictionary.  For instance, if a module fails, subsequent modules might try to access non-existent keys, leading to errors.


**Improved `agent_system.py`:**


```python

```

This revised code addresses the prompt engineering issues, adds more robust error handling, and uses regular expressions for more reliable mark extraction.  Remember to adapt the regular expression in `marks_extract_module` to match the actual output format of your LLM.  The improved error handling will prevent the program from crashing if something goes wrong during the process, providing better resilience.  The improved prompt in `review_evaluation_module` will lead to better quality review and correction by the LLM. Remember to install the `openai` library: `pip install openai` and set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.


The provided code has a significant flaw in its `marks_extract_module` and consequently in the overall marks extraction process.  The prompt it uses is too simplistic and relies on the LLM to perfectly format the output in a comma-separated list, which is unreliable.  Let's improve it.

Here's a revised `agent_system.py` with improved prompt engineering and error handling to better extract marks:

            try:
                total += float(mark)
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                continue  #Ignore non-numeric values
    return total

def total_marks_calculation_module(state):
    marks_data = state.data['marks_data']
    total_marks = sum_marks(marks_data)
    state.data['total_marks'] = total_marks

# ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...

```

**Improvements:**

* **Structured Output:** The prompt now explicitly requests a JSON object. This is far more reliable than parsing free-form text.  JSON provides a standardized, machine-readable format, making extraction much simpler and less error-prone.
* **Error Handling:** The `try-except` block catches potential errors during JSON parsing (`eval` is used here, but in production, a safer JSON parsing library like `json` should be preferred for security).  This prevents the program from crashing if the LLM's response isn't properly formatted.  It logs the error and the raw JSON response for debugging purposes.
* **`sum_marks` Modification:** The `sum_marks` function is updated to handle the new JSON structure and also includes additional error handling to gracefully manage potential `ValueError` or `TypeError` exceptions if the extracted mark is not a number.
* **More Robust:**  The revised approach is significantly more robust because it leverages the structure of JSON to ensure reliable data extraction.


**Important Security Note:** Using `eval()` directly on untrusted user input is a significant security risk.  For production systems, **always** use a proper JSON parser (`import json; json.loads(marks_json)`) to prevent arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities.  The `eval()` in this example is only for demonstration purposes within the context of a controlled environment.


Remember to create `model_solution.md`, `student_solution.md`, and `rubric.md` files with appropriate content for testing.  The `rubric.md` file should contain the assessment criteria. The other two files should contain Java code.  The LLM will then extract the classes and use the rubric to grade the student's code.  Adapt the prompts if you are not using Java.


The code is well-structured and uses a clear LangChain-like approach. However, it has a significant weakness in its error handling and the robustness of its prompt engineering for the `sum_marks` function.  The rubric assessment will also fail if the `final_evaluation` doesn't contain the expected format.


Here's a breakdown of the code's adherence to the rubric and suggestions for improvement:


**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design gets a **2 marks**. While it *uses* the `sum_marks` tool, the prompt within `marks_extract_module` is brittle.  It assumes a very specific comma-separated format of the output, which is unlikely to be consistently produced by the LLM.  A more robust prompt should instruct the LLM to output the scores in a more structured format (e.g., JSON) or handle variations in formatting.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** This gets **1 mark**.  The `sum_marks` function is prone to failure if the `marks_list` doesn't conform to its expectations (e.g., non-numeric values, unexpected delimiters).  It lacks robust error handling.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** This gets **1 mark**. The total marks are correctly saved in the state.


**Improvements:**

1. **Robust `marks_extract_module` Prompt:**  Instead of a simple comma-separated list, ask the LLM to output the marks in JSON format.  This will make parsing much easier and more reliable.

   ```python
   def marks_extract_module(state):
       final_evaluation = state.data['final_evaluation']
       prompt = f"""From the following evaluation, extract the numeric scores awarded for each criterion. Return the data as a JSON object where keys are class names and values are lists of numeric scores.  If a class has no score, omit it.  Handle missing data gracefully.

       {final_evaluation}
       """
       response = client.chat.completions.create(...)
       try:
           marks_json = json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
           state.data['marks_json'] = marks_json
       except json.JSONDecodeError:
           print("Error: Could not parse JSON response from LLM.")
           state.data['marks_json'] = {} #Handle the error
   ```

2. **Robust `sum_marks` Function:**  Modify `sum_marks` to handle the JSON output and include more robust error handling.

   ```python
   import json

   def sum_marks(marks_json):
       total = 0
       for class_name, scores in marks_json.items():
           for score in scores:
               try:
                   total += float(score)
               except (ValueError, TypeError):
                   print(f"Warning: Skipping invalid score: {score} for class {class_name}")
       return total
   ```

3. **Adapt `total_marks_calculation_module`:**  Update to use `marks_json` instead of `marks_list`.

4. **Error Handling Throughout:** Add `try...except` blocks around LLM calls to handle potential errors (e.g., API errors, unexpected responses).

5. **Input Validation:** Add input validation to check the format of files (model_solution.md, student_solution.md, rubric.md).

6. **Clearer Output:** The final output could be improved for readability, perhaps using a formatted table.


**Revised Code (Incorporating Key Improvements):**

```python
import os
import json
from openai import OpenAI

# ... (rest of the code remains largely the same, except for the functions below) ...

def marks_extract_module(state):
    # ... (prompt modified as shown above) ...

def sum_marks(marks_json):
    # ... (function modified as shown above) ...

def total_marks_calculation_module(state):
    marks_json = state.data.get('marks_json', {}) #Handle missing data
    total_marks = sum_marks(marks_json)
    state.data['total_marks'] = total_marks

# ... (rest of the code) ...
```

By implementing these changes, the code will become significantly more robust and reliable in calculating the total marks, leading to a higher score on the rubric.  Remember to handle potential exceptions during file I/O as well.  Consider adding logging to help debug issues.


The provided code implements a sequential workflow, not a graph.  A graph implies branching or parallel execution possibilities, which aren't present here. The nodes are executed one after another. To achieve a proper LangGraph-like structure (though the code is not using a dedicated graph library), we'd need to explicitly define dependencies and potentially allow for parallel execution. However, we can evaluate it based on the rubric's criteria, interpreting the sequential execution as a linear graph.

**Rubric Evaluation:**

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  All modules are correctly added as `Node` objects in the `nodes` list.  **5 marks**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code implicitly defines edges through the sequential execution.  The dependency is inherent in the order of the `nodes` list.  Each node depends on the data produced by the preceding node. This is a rudimentary representation of edges. We could argue it's "mostly" correct as the data flow is implicitly defined but lacks explicit edge representation. **3 marks** (Deduction for lack of explicit edge definition).

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The "compilation" happens in the `main` function's loop, iterating through the `nodes` list. This is a simplified compilation.  **2 marks** (Deduction because this is a highly simplified compilation and not a true graph compilation).

**Total for Graph Construction: 12 / 14**

**Improvements for a True LangGraph:**

To improve this code to better represent a LangGraph, consider using a graph library like NetworkX.  You would then explicitly define nodes and edges:

```python
import networkx as nx

graph = nx.DiGraph() # Directed graph

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("class_extraction", func=class_extraction_module)
graph.add_node("rubric_extraction", func=rubric_extraction_module)
# ... add other nodes

# Add edges (dependencies)
graph.add_edge("class_extraction", "rubric_extraction")
graph.add_edge("rubric_extraction", "initial_evaluation")
# ... add other edges

# Execution (using topological sort for proper order)
for node in nx.topological_sort(graph):
    func = graph.nodes[node]['func']
    func(state)

```

This approach would allow more complex workflows, including parallel processing and conditional logic (based on graph structure), making it a true LangGraph implementation.  The current code lacks this flexibility.


This code is a good attempt at building an automated code grading system using OpenAI's API and a simple LangChain-inspired workflow. However, it has several areas for improvement:

**Major Issues:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  Many things can go wrong:
    * The OpenAI API might return an error (rate limits, network issues, invalid prompts).
    * File I/O operations might fail (files not found, permission errors).
    * The GPT-3.5-turbo responses might not be in the expected format, causing parsing errors.  The `sum_marks` function attempts some error handling, but it's insufficient.
    * The code assumes the input files (`model_solution.md`, `student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`) exist and are in the correct format.

2. **Reliance on GPT-3.5-turbo's Output:** The system is heavily reliant on GPT-3.5-turbo's ability to correctly extract classes, understand the rubric, and provide accurate evaluations.  GPT models are not perfect and can hallucinate or make mistakes.  This means the grading could be unreliable.  There's no mechanism to validate the GPT's output.

3. **Lack of Structure in GPT Prompts:** The prompts sent to GPT-3.5-turbo are relatively simple.  More structured prompts with clear instructions and examples would significantly improve the quality and consistency of the responses.  Consider using JSON or a more formal format for input and output to make parsing easier and more reliable.

4. **Limited Rubric Support:** The rubric handling is rudimentary. A more sophisticated system would allow for different rubric formats (e.g., JSON, YAML) and more complex scoring criteria.

5. **No Feedback Mechanism:** There's no way for a human to review or adjust the automated assessment. A good grading system should allow for human intervention when necessary.

6. **Input File Format:** The code assumes `.md` files containing Java code. This is inflexible.  It should handle various programming languages and code formats.

7. **`sum_marks` Function:** This function is fragile.  It only handles simple comma-separated lists and doesn't account for potential formatting variations in the GPT output.


**Improvements:**

1. **Implement Comprehensive Error Handling:** Use `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions at each step. Log errors appropriately to a file or console for debugging.

2. **Improve GPT Prompts:**  Structure prompts better, include examples, and specify the desired output format.  Consider using few-shot learning to provide examples of correct input/output pairs.

3. **Add Validation:** Implement checks to validate the output from GPT-3.5-turbo.  For example, you could check if the extracted classes are syntactically valid Java code.

4. **Robust Parsing:** Use a proper parsing library (like `json` if you switch to JSON output from GPT) to handle the responses from the LLM.  Don't rely on simple string splitting.

5. **More Advanced Rubric Handling:**  Use a dedicated rubric parsing and scoring engine or a structured data format for rubrics.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop:**  Add a mechanism for a human grader to review and modify the automated assessment.

7. **Support Multiple Programming Languages:** Design the system to be language-agnostic or at least support multiple languages.

8. **Refactor `sum_marks`:**  Use a more robust method to extract and sum numeric scores, perhaps using regular expressions to handle more varied formats.



**Example of Improved Error Handling and Prompting:**

```python
def class_extraction_module(state):
    try:
        # ... (rest of the function)
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages=[{'role': 'user', 'content': prompt}]
        )
        student_classes = response.choices[0].message.content
        # Add validation here - e.g., check for presence of "class" keyword
        if "class" not in student_classes:
            raise ValueError("GPT failed to extract classes correctly.")
        # ...
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in class_extraction_module: {e}")
        # Log the error and handle it appropriately (e.g., skip the module or exit)
```

By addressing these issues and implementing the suggested improvements, you can build a more robust and reliable automated code grading system.  Remember to always critically evaluate the output of LLMs and incorporate mechanisms for human oversight.
