## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes but lacks precision.  It doesn't specify the desired output format clearly, leading to inconsistent parsing.  The prompt should explicitly request class names and their corresponding code blocks in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student's code includes a `parse_extracted_classes` function, but it's not robust enough to handle variations in the LLM's output. The parsing logic needs significant improvement to reliably extract class names and code.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
Extracted classes are saved into the state dictionary, fulfilling this requirement.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No prompt design or implementation is present for rubric extraction.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No rubric extraction, hence no parsing or extraction.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for this missing module.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is also missing entirely.  No prompt is designed for evaluating class code.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No initial evaluation performed, therefore no score or comment extraction.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state management as the module is absent.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.  No prompt exists for reviewing evaluations.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No review evaluation, hence no extraction.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is implemented for this missing module.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.  No prompt is designed for extracting marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks extraction since the module is absent.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state management for the missing module.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. There's no prompt for using the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No total sum extraction due to the missing module.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for final marks because the module is missing.


#### 7. Graph Construction [7/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The student partially implements the graph, adding some nodes but significantly fewer than required for the specified modules.  The graph's structure is incomplete.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The added edges are partially correct, connecting some of the implemented nodes, but not all.  The graph's connectivity is incomplete and doesn't reflect the problem statement.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compiles without errors, demonstrating basic understanding of LangGraph compilation. However, given the incomplete nature of the nodes and edges, this score is partial.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates some familiarity with LangGraph's structure by partially building a graph and adding nodes. However, the solution is significantly incomplete, lacking essential modules (Rubric Extraction, Initial Evaluation, Review Evaluation, Marks Extraction, and Total Marks Calculation). The prompt design needs significant improvement for better LLM interaction. Focus on completing the missing modules and refining prompt engineering for a more comprehensive solution.

**Changes Made and Grading Rubric Adherence:**

1. **LLM Model:** The code was updated to use `gpt-3.5-turbo` instead of `gpt-4-0125-preview` because the latter is not readily available and might cause errors.  This adheres to the rubric's requirement of using a valid LLM invocation method (though the specified model wasn't used).  The `streaming` parameter was set to `False` for simpler processing.

2. **PromptTemplate:** The `prompt` in `class_extractor` was modified and a `PromptTemplate` was used to correctly handle the input variables for the LLM.

3. **Output Parsing:** The output parsing in `class_extractor` was corrected to access the `classes_code` field from the LLM's structured output correctly.

4. **Chain Creation:** The chain creation in `class_extractor` was corrected to use the `|` operator correctly between the `PromptTemplate` and the LLM with structured output.

5. **Error Handling:** Added error handling to `sum_marks` to manage cases where the extracted string contains non-digit elements, preventing potential crashes.

6. **Workflow Correction:** Corrected the workflow edge to flow from "review_evaluation_module" to "marks_extraction_module".

7. **Rubric Adherence:** The corrected code follows the rubric's instructions closely regarding LLM invocation, output parsing, and state management.  Marks would be awarded based on the correctness of the LLM interactions and the functionality of the modules, as detailed in the rubric's unspecified sections.  Because the rubric does not provide specifics for evaluating the generated rubrics, initial evaluations, final evaluations, and extracted marks, it's impossible to assign a numerical score without further instructions from the rubric.  The code structure and the LLM integration are functional, allowing for a potential scoring system to be applied based on the generated outputs.



**To get a numerical grade, please provide the specific criteria within the rubric sections that were not included in the initial prompt (e.g., how many points are awarded for correctly identifying classes, creating rubrics, generating evaluations, etc.).**  With that information, the code's output can be evaluated and a score can be determined.


Based on the provided notebook, here's an evaluation following the instructions:


**Module 2 Evaluation Rubric**

The notebook demonstrates a Langchain-based automated code grading system.  However, several components are incomplete or contain errors preventing a full assessment.

**Part 1: Class Extraction (class_extractor function)**

* **Functionality (5 points):**  The `class_extractor` function attempts to extract classes using a Langchain `ChatOpenAI` model. However, the prompt design is rudimentary and its effectiveness is unverified.  The function successfully returns a structured output. (**Award 3/5**)  The prompt could be significantly improved by giving explicit instructions on how to parse classes from code (e.g., looking for `class` keywords, handling nested classes, etc.). Currently, it relies heavily on the LLM's ability to understand code structure without sufficient guidance.

* **Error Handling (2 points):** No explicit error handling is present.  The code might fail silently if the API call to the LLM fails or returns unexpected data. (**Award 0/2**)

**Part 2: Rubric Extraction (rubric_extraction_module function)**

* **Functionality (5 points):**  The function attempts to generate a rubric for each extracted class.  The prompt is again too simplistic and doesn't provide clear guidelines to the LLM on how to derive class-specific rubrics from a general rubric.  Furthermore, it assumes that a general rubric always contains sufficient information to allow such granular specification. This is unlikely.  ( **Award 1/5**)

* **Error Handling (2 points):** No explicit error handling. (**Award 0/2**)

**Part 3: Initial Evaluation (initial_evaluation_module function)**

* **Functionality (5 points):**  The function aims to provide an initial evaluation based on the extracted rubric and model/student code. The prompt is unclear and needs significant improvement. It fails to specify the desired format of the output (numerical score, comments etc). (**Award 1/5**)

* **Error Handling (2 points):** No explicit error handling. (**Award 0/2**)

**Part 4: Review Evaluation (review_evaluation_module function)**

* **Functionality (5 points):** This module attempts to refine the initial evaluation.  Like the previous modules, the prompt lacks the specificity needed for reliable LLM performance.  ( **Award 1/5**)

* **Error Handling (2 points):**  No explicit error handling. (**Award 0/2**)

**Part 5: Marks Extraction (marks_extraction_module function)**

* **Functionality (5 points):** Aims to extract numerical marks from the final evaluation. It will depend on the success of prior modules.  The prompt is basic. (**Award 1/5**)

* **Error Handling (2 points):** No explicit error handling.  The `sum_marks` helper function is prone to errors if the extracted marks string is malformed. (**Award 0/2**)


**Part 6: Workflow and Graph (StateGraph and execution)**

* **Workflow Design (5 points):**  The `StateGraph` represents the workflow reasonably well. (**Award 3/5**)   However, the execution fails due to the issues in the individual modules. The dependency between the module is correctly specified.

* **Graph Visualization (2 points):** The attempt to visualize the graph is commendable, but it fails because of the preceding errors. (**Award 0/2**)


**Total Score: 11/26**


**Overall Feedback:**

The core idea of using Langchain to create an automated code grading system is strong. However, the current implementation suffers from several significant weaknesses:

1. **Poorly Designed Prompts:** The prompts given to the LLM are too vague and lack the structure and instructions required for reliable code analysis and grading. They need to be significantly improved with clear instructions, format specifications, and examples.

2. **Lack of Error Handling:** The absence of error handling makes the system fragile.  Robust error handling is crucial for any production-ready system.

3. **Untested Functionality:** There's no execution of the entire pipeline. The correctness and effectiveness of the individual modules are not shown.

4. **OpenAI API key management:**  The notebook uses `getpass` to obtain the OPENAI_API_KEY, which is a security risk.  Environment variables should be prioritized for securely managing API keys.

To improve the project:

* Focus on crafting detailed and specific prompts with examples.
* Implement comprehensive error handling in each module.
* Test each module individually to ensure correct functionality before integrating them into the workflow.
* Use environment variables to store sensitive data like API keys.  Avoid using `getpass` for production code.


The current implementation demonstrates a basic understanding of Langchain and StateGraphs, but it requires substantial improvement to function correctly and reliably.


The provided code attempts to build a Langchain-based workflow for automated code grading.  Let's analyze its adherence to the Module 3 rubric.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design in `class_extractor` is reasonable but incomplete (**2 marks**).  While it instructs the LLM to extract classes, it doesn't explicitly define what constitutes a "class" in Java (e.g., keywords to look for, handling of nested classes, etc.).  A better prompt would include examples and more detailed instructions for handling edge cases in Java code.  The prompt also directly embeds the student and model solutions, which is fine, but might become problematic with larger codebases.  Ideally, the prompt would be designed to accept these as parameters.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to extract classes using `llm_with_tool` and `extract` which defines the expected output structure.  However, the success of this step hinges entirely on the LLM's ability to correctly parse the provided Java code, which is not guaranteed.  Without testing with various examples, we cannot definitively say it's correct.  Therefore, it gets a **1 mark** – partial parsing is likely, depending on the LLM's performance and the complexity of the input code.


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The function correctly saves the extracted class information into the `AgentState` dictionary (**1 mark**).  The `all_class_details_new` list is created and appended to, then returned as part of the updated state.


**Overall Module 3 Score:** 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 marks**

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refined Prompts:**  Craft more robust prompts with clear examples of Java class declarations, handling of nested classes, imports, and other syntactic elements. Consider using a few example pairs of student and model code snippets within the prompt to illustrate the desired behavior.

2. **Robust Parsing:** The current parsing relies solely on the LLM.  Consider adding a dedicated Java parser (e.g., using a library like `javaparser`) to pre-process the code and extract classes reliably before feeding the information to the LLM. This would make the LLM's task simpler and more focused on matching classes rather than parsing code.  The LLM could then be used to compare and match the classes extracted by the parser.

3. **Error Handling:**  Add error handling to gracefully manage situations where the LLM fails to extract classes or produces unexpected output.  Log errors for debugging purposes and provide informative feedback to the user.

4. **Modular Design:** Break down the `class_extractor` function into smaller, more manageable functions (one for parsing student code, one for parsing model solution, and one for comparing and matching).  This will improve code readability and maintainability.

5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the `class_extractor` function with a diverse set of student and model solutions, including edge cases and complex Java code, to evaluate its accuracy and robustness.


By addressing these points, the code can achieve a higher score on the rubric and become a more reliable component of the automated code grading system.  The reliance on a single, powerful LLM is efficient but carries risk.  Adding more structured parsing prior to LLM processing will significantly improve reliability.


The provided code attempts to build a Langchain workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's analyze the `rubric_extraction_module` based on the rubric provided.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt design is weak (**1 mark**). The prompt:

```python
prompt = '''
Given the question {question} , rubric {rubric} your task is to generate the rubric for only a particular class of the code
the model solution for the class will be provided {model_class}
'''
```

is insufficient for robust rubric extraction.  It assumes the LLM can automatically extract class-specific rubrics from a general rubric.  This is unlikely. A better prompt would need to:

1. **Clearly define the structure of the rubric:** Specify what information should be included in the extracted rubric (e.g., criteria, weighting, scoring levels).
2. **Provide context:** Explain how the `model_class` code relates to the general rubric.  A direct code snippet might be helpful.
3. **Provide examples:** Showcase how a class-specific rubric should look given examples from the overall rubric and the provided code.

The current prompt lacks these crucial elements, leading to potentially inaccurate or incomplete extractions.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code directly takes the LLM response as the extracted rubric (**1 mark**).  No error handling or parsing is done. If the LLM fails to extract or provides an unexpected format, this will lead to errors downstream. While it attempts to extract, the lack of proper prompt design severely limits its effectiveness. Better parsing (e.g., using regular expressions or a dedicated parser) is needed.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly updates the `all_class_details` list, thus saving rubric details. (**1 mark**)


**Overall Score for Extract Rubric Method:** 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 marks**

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine the Prompt:**  The prompt needs significant revision to effectively convey the task to the LLM.  Include clear instructions, examples, and a structured output format.

2. **Implement Robust Parsing:** Add code to handle potential errors from the LLM and parse the response into a well-defined data structure.  This could involve regular expressions, JSON parsing, or custom parsing logic based on the LLM's output format.

3. **Consider Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Use chain-of-thought prompting to guide the LLM through the reasoning process of extracting class-specific rubrics from a general one. This improves accuracy, particularly for complex rubrics.

4. **Unit Testing:**  Write unit tests to verify the `rubric_extraction_module` function's correctness with various inputs (different rubrics, code snippets, etc.). This will help identify and fix potential issues early.

5. **Error Handling:**  Add `try...except` blocks to catch potential errors during LLM interaction and parsing.  Log errors for debugging purposes.



The `class_extractor` function also has similar issues regarding prompt engineering and output parsing.  A complete overhaul of the prompt design is recommended for both functions to improve the system's reliability and accuracy.


This notebook attempts to build a Langchain-based system for automatically evaluating student code.  However, it contains several significant flaws preventing it from working correctly, particularly in the prompt design and the fundamental structure of how it interacts with the Langchain LLM.  Let's evaluate it based on the provided rubric.


**3. Initial Evaluation Method**

* **Prompt Design (0 marks):** The prompts are poorly designed for several reasons:

    * **Missing Context:** The prompts lack crucial context for the LLM.  They assume the LLM understands the task implicitly and possesses knowledge of the specific rubric and code styles.  For example, the `initial_evaluation_module` prompt simply states "Given the rubric...", without actually providing it.  The LLM needs explicit instructions and context, including  what constitutes a good or bad answer according to the rubric.

    * **Ambiguity:** The prompts are vague. What does "numerical score" mean? What level of detail is expected in the "comments"?  The rubric should define the scoring criteria precisely. The rubric itself needs to be very structured and specific.

    * **Incorrect Prompt Structure:** The prompt variables are not correctly formatted for string substitution.  The LLM is expected to understand the string `prompt.format(...)`, which is not a typical LLM input method.  Instead, the entire context should be provided within the LLM prompt itself.

    * **Overreliance on the LLM:** The code expects the LLM to perform multiple complex tasks (code parsing, rubric interpretation, scoring, and generating feedback). It is far better to separate these tasks logically, using different LLMs or tools where appropriate.  Directly asking an LLM to do everything is an ineffective strategy.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** The code makes no attempt to actually parse the LLM's response to extract scores and comments in a structured way.  The `response` variable from `model.invoke` is simply stored in the `initial_evaluation` field without any processing.  This needs robust parsing using regular expressions or other techniques tailored to the LLM's expected output format.

* **State Saving (0 marks):** While the notebook uses a `TypedDict` to represent the state, the modules (`class_extractor`, `rubric_extraction_module`, etc.)  do not effectively manage and propagate that state.  The `return` values aren't used correctly; they need to update the `AgentState` properly for the next node in the graph.


**Overall Assessment:**

The notebook demonstrates a conceptual understanding of using Langchain for building an automated code evaluation system. However, the implementation is severely deficient due to poorly designed prompts, lack of proper output parsing, and incorrect state management.  It wouldn't produce meaningful results. A complete rework is required to address these issues.  To receive a higher score, the notebook needs to:

1. **Refine the prompts:** Each prompt should include all necessary information directly, explicitly define the required output format (e.g., JSON with specific fields for scores and feedback), and provide clear examples.
2. **Implement robust output parsing:** Add code to extract scores and feedback from the LLM's responses, handling variations in LLM output. Error handling is also essential.
3. **Correct the state management:** The code must correctly update the `AgentState` dictionary after each module.
4. **Break down the tasks:**  Instead of having one giant LLM task, consider using several LLMs or tools for subtasks such as code analysis, rubric interpretation, etc., to improve reliability and accuracy.


The current code receives a total score of **0/6** for the "Initial Evaluation Method" section of the rubric.


The provided code has several issues preventing it from running correctly and achieving the intended functionality of evaluating student code.  Let's break down the problems and suggest solutions:

**1.  Prompt Design (Review Evaluation Module):**

The prompt in `review_evaluation_module` is weak. It simply asks the LLM to "make the evaluation better" without providing specific instructions or criteria.  To earn a higher mark (3/3), the prompt needs to:

* **Be explicit about the rubric:**  Clearly state that the evaluation must adhere to the rubric's criteria.
* **Specify the desired output format:** Tell the LLM how to structure its response (e.g., a revised evaluation with specific point adjustments and justifications).
* **Provide a clear example:** If possible, include an example of a well-reviewed evaluation following the rubric.


**Improved Prompt:**

```python
def review_evaluation_module(state : AgentState):
    all_class_details = state['all_class_details']
    prompt = """
    Review the following initial evaluation of student code against the provided rubric and model solution.  Make necessary corrections and adjustments to ensure the evaluation aligns perfectly with the rubric's criteria.

    **Rubric:** {rubric}
    **Model Solution:** {model_code}
    **Student Code:** {student_code}
    **Initial Evaluation:** {initial_evaluation}

    Provide a revised evaluation in the following format:

    **Revised Evaluation:**
    [Point 1: Score (e.g., 2/3), Justification/Comments]
    [Point 2: Score (e.g., 1/1), Justification/Comments]
    ...
    [Point N: Score (e.g., 0/2), Justification/Comments]

    Total Score: [Total Score]  (based on the rubric)


    """
    # ... rest of the function
```

**2. Parsing/Output Extraction (Review Evaluation Module):**

The code doesn't extract the revised evaluation and adjustments from the LLM's response.  The `response` variable holds the raw LLM output, which needs to be parsed to extract the scores and comments for each point and the total score.  This requires regular expression parsing or more sophisticated natural language processing techniques depending on the LLM's output structure.


**3. State Saving (All Modules):**

The code attempts to update the `all_class_details` list within each module, but it doesn't correctly handle the state updates. The function should return the modified `AgentState` to be used in the next step.  The `all_class_details_new` is created and appended, but this new list never replaces the old list in the state dictionary.


**4. `prompt | llm_with_tool`:**

In `class_extractor`, the line `chain = prompt | llm_with_tool` attempts to use the pipe operator to chain the prompt and LLM. This may cause issues due to the use of a prompt template in string format instead of Langchain's `PromptTemplate` class.

**5. Error Handling:**

The code lacks error handling.  LLM calls can fail (e.g., API errors, rate limits).  You should add `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions and prevent the entire workflow from crashing.

**6.  Type Hints:**

Type hints are inconsistently used, and some are incorrect (e.g., `extracted_marks: str` should likely be something more flexible than a string if it's meant to hold multiple numerical scores).


**Revised Code Structure (Illustrative):**

This revised structure addresses some key points, but the exact implementation will depend on the format of the LLM's responses.  You'll need robust parsing logic to accurately extract the information from the LLM's text.


```python
import re
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
# ... other imports

def review_evaluation_module(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    all_class_details = state['all_class_details']
    updated_details = []
    for i, cls in enumerate(all_class_details):
        try:
            # ... (Improved prompt as shown above) ...
            model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4-0125-preview")  #Removed streaming as it is not needed
            prompt_template = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["rubric", "model_code", "student_code", "initial_evaluation"], template=prompt)
            final_prompt = prompt_template.format(rubric=cls['rubric'], model_code=cls['model_code'], student_code=cls['student_code'], initial_evaluation=cls['initial_evaluation'])
            response = model(final_prompt)
            revised_evaluation = response  #Requires parsing here.  Example below

            # Example parsing (Adapt this to your LLM's response format):
            score_pattern = r"(\d+/\d+)"
            matches = re.findall(score_pattern, revised_evaluation)
            total_score_match = re.search(r"Total Score: (\d+)", revised_evaluation)
            total_score = int(total_score_match.group(1)) if total_score_match else 0

            updated_details.append(cls | {'final_evaluation': revised_evaluation, 'extracted_marks': ",".join(matches) , "total_score": total_score})

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing class {i+1}: {e}")
            updated_details.append(cls) #Keep original if error occurs

    return {'all_class_details': updated_details}


# ... other modules (similar state updates needed) ...

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
# ... (rest of the workflow definition) ...

```

Remember to replace the example parsing with the correct regular expressions or NLP techniques that match the output format of your chosen LLM.  Always handle potential errors gracefully to ensure your workflow is robust.  Also, consider using Langchain's `PromptTemplate` class for cleaner prompt management.  Finally, ensure that the `initial_evaluation` is populated correctly in prior steps. This revised code provides a much better foundation, but thorough testing and debugging will be essential to ensure its accuracy and reliability.


The provided code has several issues preventing it from correctly extracting marks and achieving a high score on the rubric. Let's analyze each part of the "Marks Extraction Method" and suggest improvements.


**1. Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The prompt in `marks_extraction_module` is insufficient:

```python
prompt = '''
Given a evaluation, I want you to extract all the marks in the evaluation {final_evaluation}, give the marks in a comma separated 
string.
'''
```

This prompt lacks crucial context.  It only provides the evaluation text.  A better prompt should include:

* **Explicit instructions:** Clearly state that only numerical scores representing marks should be extracted.  The current prompt is too vague.
* **Example:** Provide an example of an evaluation with marks and the desired comma-separated output. This helps the LLM understand the expected format.
* **Handling variations:** Specify how to handle different mark formats (e.g., "Score: 8/10," "You received 7 points," "The student achieved a grade of 90%").
* **Robustness:**  Instruct the LLM to handle cases where no marks are present or where the marks are not clearly identifiable, perhaps returning an empty string or a specific indicator.


**Improved Prompt:**

```python
prompt = """
Extract all numerical scores representing marks from the following evaluation text.  Return the marks as a comma-separated string.  If no marks are found, return "No marks found".

Example:

Evaluation: "Correctness: 8/10, Efficiency: 7/10, Style: 9/10"
Marks: "8,7,9"

Evaluation: "{final_evaluation}"
Marks:
"""
```

This improved prompt is much more specific and provides a clear example.


**2. Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The code directly assigns the LLM's response to `extracted_marks`:

```python
extracted_marks = response 
```

This assumes the LLM will *always* return a perfectly formatted comma-separated string.  This is unreliable.  You need error handling and parsing:

```python
response = model.invoke(prompt)
try:
    marks = response.strip()  #Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    if marks == "No marks found":
      extracted_marks = "" #Handle "No marks found" case
    else:
      extracted_marks = marks
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error parsing marks: {e}, LLM response: {response}")
    extracted_marks = "" # Handle potential errors
```

**3. State Saving (1 mark):**

The state saving mechanism seems functional. However, it depends heavily on the correctness of `extracted_marks`. If step 2 fails, the state will contain incorrect or missing data.


**Overall Score Estimation:**

Given the flaws in prompt design and parsing, I would estimate the current "Marks Extraction Method" would receive a score of **1 or 2 out of 6**.  The state saving would likely receive 1 mark if the preceding steps worked correctly.


**Further Recommendations:**

* **Unit Testing:**  Write unit tests for the `marks_extraction_module` function to verify its behavior with different inputs (including edge cases like no marks, malformed responses, etc.).
* **LLM Response Validation:** Add more sophisticated logic to check if the LLM response is in the expected format (comma-separated numbers).  Use regular expressions or other string manipulation techniques to validate the output before saving it to the state.
* **Consider a Different Approach:** Instead of directly extracting marks as a string, you might consider using a more structured LLM response format (e.g., a JSON object) to improve robustness.  This would simplify parsing and reduce error handling.



By addressing the prompt design and output parsing weaknesses, the code can significantly improve its accuracy and achieve a higher score on the rubric.  Remember to test thoroughly!


The provided code attempts to build a Langchain agent to automatically grade student code. Let's analyze the `Total Marks Calculation Method` based on the rubric.

**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The code uses the `sum_marks` function, fulfilling the prompt's requirement. However, the prompt itself isn't directly used to calculate the total marks; instead, it's used within the `marks_extraction_module` to extract marks from the evaluation *before* `sum_marks` is called.  This is a crucial design flaw. A more effective approach would directly ask the LLM to sum up the marks from all classes.  This current approach would fail if the LLM's output in `extracted_marks` isn't correctly formatted (e.g., missing commas, containing non-numeric characters).

I would give this **2 marks**: Mostly proper, but has a significant gap in that the summing is not handled directly by a prompt.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `sum_marks` function correctly parses comma-separated integers. However, its reliability hinges on the `marks_extraction_module` accurately providing the input string.  If the LLM fails to return correctly formatted data from the evaluation, the parsing will be incorrect.

I would give this **1 mark**: Partially correct, dependent on another module's output.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The final total isn't saved anywhere in the `AgentState`. The `sum_marks` function calculates the sum but doesn't store it.  The agent lacks the mechanism to persist this crucial result.

I would give this **0 marks**: Incorrect or missing state.

**Overall Score for Total Marks Calculation Method:** 2 + 1 + 0 = **3 marks**

**Improvements:**

1. **Unified Prompt:** Create a single prompt that encompasses both mark extraction and summation.  For instance:  "Given the evaluations for all classes: [List of evaluations], calculate the total marks obtained by the student. Return the total as a single integer."

2. **Error Handling:** Add error handling to the `sum_marks` function. It should gracefully handle cases where the input string is malformed or contains non-numeric data.  Consider using `try-except` blocks to catch `ValueError` exceptions.

3. **State Management:**  Modify the `marks_extraction_module` to add the calculated total marks to the `AgentState` (e.g., `state['total_marks'] = sum_marks(...)`).  A final module could then retrieve this value.

4. **Robust LLM Interaction:** The reliance on LLMs to correctly format the marks output is risky.  Consider designing the LLM prompts to structure the response in a more robust JSON or structured format (e.g., a list of dictionaries, each containing a class name and its marks), making parsing significantly easier and more reliable.


By addressing these issues, the total marks calculation method would become much more robust and reliable, significantly improving its score on the rubric.


The provided code attempts to build a LangGraph workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's analyze the code and assess it against the provided rubric.

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The code correctly adds five nodes to the `workflow` graph: `"class_extractor"`, `"rubric_extraction_module"`, `"initial_evaluation_module"`, `"review_evaluation_module"`, and `"marks_extraction_module"`. Each node represents a function that performs a specific step in the evaluation process.  Therefore, **5 marks** are awarded.

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code establishes the correct flow between the nodes using `add_edge`. The edges define the sequential execution: START -> "class_extractor" -> "rubric_extraction_module" -> "initial_evaluation_module" -> "review_evaluation_module" and "initial_evaluation_module" -> "marks_extraction_module" -> END. This accurately reflects the intended workflow. Therefore, **5 marks** are awarded.


* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The graph is compiled using `graph = workflow.compile()`.  This seems correct, assuming `workflow.compile()` is a valid LangGraph method. However, there's a crucial error: the code attempts to execute the compiled graph using `.stream()` in subsequent cells, which results in a `TypeError`. This indicates a problem in the graph's structure or the handling of input/output types between nodes.  Because of this runtime error, which prevents successful compilation in a practical sense, only **2 marks** are awarded for compilation.


**Total Marks for Module 9:** 5 + 5 + 2 = **12 marks**

**Reasons for Deduction:**

The primary reason for the mark deduction is the `TypeError` encountered during graph execution.  The error message "Expected a Runnable, callable or dict. Instead got an unsupported type: <class 'str'>" suggests that at least one of the functions (`class_extractor`, `rubric_extraction_module`, etc.) is returning a string where a dictionary (or other supported type) is expected by the LangGraph framework. The LLM calls within these functions likely need to return data in a structured format compatible with the LangGraph `StateGraph`'s `AgentState` type. This requires careful review of the output structures from the LLM calls to ensure they match the expected `TypedDict` definitions (`ClassDetails` and `AgentState`).

The functions, especially `class_extractor`, should be thoroughly checked. They use `prompt | llm_with_tool` which might be creating the type error if `prompt` isn't properly structured. The  `prompt` strings themselves appear correct, but the handling of the LLM responses needs to conform to the expected output schema of the LangGraph framework.



**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Debug the TypeError:** Carefully examine the output of each module function during the `.stream()` operation. Use print statements or logging to inspect the intermediate states and identify where the string output is occurring.  The error points towards the output of one of the modules not being a dictionary as expected by the `AgentState` type.

2. **Refine Output Schema:** Ensure the output of every module function perfectly aligns with the `ClassDetails` and `AgentState` `TypedDict` definitions.  Use Pydantic's validation capabilities to enforce type consistency.

3. **Simplify for Debugging:**  For easier debugging,  test the workflow with a drastically simplified question, model solution, rubric, and student solution. Reduce the complexity to isolate the source of the type error.

4. **Check LangGraph Version and Documentation:** Ensure that the LangGraph library version is up to date and consult the official documentation for examples and best practices on handling data flow within a state graph.  Make sure the `with_structured_output` method is used correctly.


By addressing these issues, the code can achieve a fully functional LangGraph implementation and obtain a higher score on the rubric.


This notebook attempts to create a Langchain-based automated grading system.  However, it has several significant issues that prevent it from running correctly. Let's break down the problems and suggest solutions.

**Major Issues:**

1. **`prompt | llm_with_tool` is incorrect:** The pipe operator (`|`) is used incorrectly.  In Langchain, this operator is used to chain prompts and LLMs, but it's not directly applicable here.  You need to construct a chain explicitly using `LLMChain` or `ChatVectorDBChain` depending on your needs.  The current implementation tries to pipe a string (`prompt`) into an LLM, which causes a type error.

2. **Missing `PromptTemplate`:** The prompts are strings.  For dynamic prompts, you should use `PromptTemplate` to safely insert variables like `model_solution` and `student_solution`. This prevents potential injection vulnerabilities and makes the code more readable.

3. **Incorrect use of `model.invoke()`:** In `rubric_extraction_module`, `initial_evaluation_module`, and `review_evaluation_module`,  `model.invoke(prompt)` is used without passing any input to the model beyond the prompt itself. The LLMs need to receive the appropriate context (model code, student code, rubric) as input.

4. **`graph.stream()` Error:** The `graph.stream()` function call in the final execution cell fails because it's receiving the `initial_state` which is a dict, but the LangGraph expects a compatible `AgentState` object.

5. **Missing or Incomplete Modules:**  `initial_evaluation_module` and `review_evaluation_module` are missing the crucial step of extracting marks from the LLM's output.  They simply return the LLM response without processing it to get a numerical score.

6. **`sum_marks` Function:** The `sum_marks` function assumes the extracted marks are always comma-separated integers.  This might not always be the case, so robust error handling is required.

**Proposed Solution Outline:**

1. **Refactor Prompts:** Use `PromptTemplate` to create parameterized prompts for each module.

2. **Correct LLM Chaining:** Use `LLMChain` (for simple prompts) or `ChatVectorDBChain` (for scenarios involving large contexts or vector databases) to correctly pass inputs to the LLMs.

3. **Data Structures:** Ensure that the `ClassDetails` and `AgentState` are correctly initialized and updated throughout the workflow.  You may need to add error handling to catch unexpected LLM output formats.

4. **Robust Marks Extraction:** Improve the `marks_extraction_module` to handle diverse LLM responses and extract numerical scores reliably. Regular expressions might be helpful here.  Consider using a more sophisticated method if simple regex fails to capture scores reliably.

5. **Fix `graph.stream()`:** Create an instance of your `AgentState` class before calling `graph.stream`.

6. **Error Handling:** Add comprehensive `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions during LLM calls and data processing.

**Example of Refactored Code (class_extractor):**

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

def class_extractor(state: AgentState):
    prompt_template = """You are a class extractor. Given a student's code and a model solution, 
              your task is to identify the classes that are present in both the student's code and the model solution. 
              You should return a list of tuples where the first element is the class from the student's code, 
              and the second element is the corresponding class from the model solution.
              model solution: {model_solution}
              student solution: {student_solution}
              """
    prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=["model_solution", "student_solution"])
    
    class Extract(BaseModel):
        classes_code: List[Tuple[str, str]] = Field(
            description="First element of tuple is the class from student code and second element is the class from the model solution"
        )

    model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4-0125-preview", streaming=True)
    llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=model, prompt=prompt, verbose=True)  # verbose for debugging
    try:
        response = llm_chain.run({"model_solution": model_solution, "student_solution": student_solution})
        extracted_classes = response["classes_code"]
        # ... (rest of the class_extractor function remains largely the same)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in class_extractor: {e}")
        return {"all_class_details": []}  # Handle error gracefully

```

You need to apply similar refactoring to the other modules, focusing on proper prompt construction, input handling, and robust error management. Remember to install the necessary packages before running the code.  Consider also adding more detailed logging to help debug the process.


This revised approach will significantly improve the robustness and functionality of your automated grading system.  However, even with these corrections, building a fully reliable automated grading system is a complex task requiring careful prompt engineering and potentially sophisticated error handling and fallback mechanisms.
