## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The student's prompt is insufficient for robust class extraction. It relies on simple keyword spotting and lacks the sophistication to handle complex Java code structures or nested classes.  It does not account for edge cases or variations in code style.


**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to extract class names, but its parsing is rudimentary. It relies on splitting the string by newline and identifying lines containing "class", which is fragile and fails in many cases.  There is no attempt to accurately extract the class code associated with each extracted class.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not properly saved into the state.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No rubric extraction method is implemented.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No rubric extraction is performed.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving related to rubric extraction is implemented.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No initial evaluation method is implemented.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No initial evaluation is performed.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving related to initial evaluation is implemented.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No review evaluation method is implemented.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No review evaluation is performed.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving related to review evaluation is implemented.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks extraction method is implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks extraction is performed.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving related to marks extraction is implemented.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No total marks calculation method is implemented.  The `sum_marks` tool from the model solution is not utilized.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No total marks calculation is performed.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving related to total marks calculation is implemented.

#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes to represent each stage of the evaluation process in the LangGraph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added edges to define the flow between the nodes, establishing a sequential evaluation pipeline.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compilation is largely successful. However, since no evaluation methods are implemented, the workflow does not achieve its intended functionality beyond setting up the graph structure.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a good understanding of LangGraph's structure and successfully built the workflow graph. However, the core functionality of the evaluation modules remains unimplemented. The prompts and parsing techniques need significant improvement to handle the complexity of the Java code and rubric analysis.  Focus on implementing robust prompt engineering and parsing strategies for each module.

**Marking Scheme:**

The rubric provides a scoring system for each criterion (Code structure and organization, Proper use of object-oriented principles, Naming conventions and readability, Error handling and input validation, Comments and documentation).  Each criterion has a maximum score of 10 points.  The solution correctly generates a rubric with these criteria and maximum points but does not provide any evaluation or marking.  Therefore, all achieved points are 0.


**Detailed Marks Awarded:**

* **Rubric Generation (10/10):** The code successfully generates a rubric with the specified criteria and maximum points. The JSON structure is correct.
* **Initial Evaluation (0/10):**  The code framework is present to perform an initial evaluation but it's missing the actual evaluation provided by the LLM.
* **Review Evaluation (0/10):** Similar to initial evaluation, the code structure exists, but no evaluation data is present.
* **Marks Extraction (0/10):**  No marks are extracted or assigned because there is no preceding evaluation.
* **Total Marks Calculation (0/10):** The total marks calculation is present but results in 0 since no marks were assigned in the previous step.

**Total Marks: 10/50**


## Module 2 Evaluation Rubric

**Grading:**  The final grade will be determined by summing the points from each section.  Partial credit may be awarded for partially correct solutions within each section, as detailed above.  Zero points will be awarded where a component is absent or entirely non-functional.



**Evaluator Feedback:** (Space for evaluator to provide detailed feedback on specific aspects of the submission, including both strengths and weaknesses.)


The provided code implements a Java code evaluation system using Langchain and Anthropic's Claude. Let's assess Module 3 based on the rubric.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The `class_extraction` function uses the following prompt:

```
    Extract the class names from the following Java code:
    {state['java_code']}
    Return only a list of class names.
```

This prompt is concise and clear.  It directly instructs the LLM to extract class names and specifies the desired output format (a list).  It effectively uses the `state['java_code']` to dynamically insert the Java code.  Therefore, this receives **3 marks**.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code then processes the LLM response:

```
    extracted_classes = [class_name.strip() for class_name in response.content.split('\n') if class_name.strip()]
```

This attempts to split the response by newline characters and clean up whitespace. However, this approach is fragile.  If the LLM's response isn't perfectly formatted (e.g., classes on a single line or with extra spaces), the parsing will fail.  It lacks error handling and robustness.  Therefore, this receives **1 mark**.


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The extracted classes are saved to `state['extracted_classes']`.  This is a correct use of state variables. Therefore, this receives **1 mark**.


**Total for Extract Class Method: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 marks**


**Overall Module 3 Score: 5 / 6**

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

* **Robust Parsing:**  The parsing of the LLM's response in `class_extraction` needs significant improvement.  Consider using regular expressions or more sophisticated parsing techniques to handle various response formats.  Add error handling to gracefully manage unexpected output.  For example, it could try to parse JSON if the newline-based splitting fails.


* **Prompt Engineering:** While the prompt is good, explore alternative prompts that might yield more reliable and structured outputs.  Experiment with prompts that explicitly request JSON or a specific structured format.  This could improve the reliability of the `safe_eval` function.


* **Testing:**  Thorough testing with diverse Java code samples (including edge cases and potential LLM errors) is crucial to ensure the robustness of the class extraction.


* **Model Choice:** The choice of `claude-3-haiku-20240307` is good, but it might be beneficial to benchmark against other models to see if they provide more consistent results.  Some models might handle code extraction better than others.

By addressing these points, the reliability and score of Module 3 can be substantially improved.


The provided code has a good structure for building a Java code evaluation system using LangChain and Anthropic's Claude. However, the `rubric_extraction` function's prompt is weak and doesn't guarantee a structured, usable rubric for automated evaluation.  This directly impacts the subsequent evaluation stages. Let's analyze the rubric module according to the provided rubric:

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt in `rubric_extraction` is significantly lacking.  It requests a rubric but doesn't specify the format. The LLM might return a free-form text description, making parsing and automated scoring impossible. A structured prompt is crucial.  A better prompt would explicitly ask for JSON or a specific table format with columns for "Criterion," "Description," and "Max Points."  This earns **1 mark** due to its incompleteness.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `safe_eval` function attempts to handle various output formats. While this is good defensive programming, it highlights the weakness of the prompt design.  If the LLM returns unstructured text, parsing will likely fail or produce unreliable results.  Given the prompt deficiency, it's a partial extraction at best.  This earns **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The rubric is correctly saved in the `state` dictionary and passed to subsequent functions. This earns **1 mark**.


**Total Score for Extract Rubric Method: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 / 6**


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refine the `rubric_extraction` prompt:**  Use a structured prompt that explicitly requests JSON output with specific keys (e.g.,  `{"criteria": [{"name": "Code Structure", "description": "...", "maxPoints": 10}, ... ]}`). Provide examples of the desired JSON format in the prompt to guide the LLM.

2. **Robust Error Handling:**  While `safe_eval` is a good start, add more specific error handling for the expected JSON structure.  If the JSON is malformed, raise an exception with informative messages to aid debugging.  Log the LLM's response for analysis.

3. **Input Validation:**  Validate the structure of the rubric received from the LLM before using it in the subsequent evaluation steps.  Check for the existence of required keys and data types.

4. **Schema Validation (Advanced):** Use a JSON schema to formally specify the expected structure of the rubric.  Libraries like `jsonschema` can validate the LLM's response against this schema, providing more rigorous validation than manual checks.


**Revised `rubric_extraction` function (example):**

```python
def rubric_extraction(state: State):
    prompt = """
    Create a rubric for evaluating Java code in JSON format.  The rubric should include criteria for:
    - Code structure and organization
    - Proper use of object-oriented principles
    - Naming conventions and readability
    - Error handling and input validation
    - Comments and documentation

    Each criterion should have: "name", "description", and "maxPoints".

    Example JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "criteria": [
        {"name": "Code Structure", "description": "Well-organized and easy to follow.", "maxPoints": 10},
        {"name": "OOP Principles", "description": "Correct use of inheritance, encapsulation, etc.", "maxPoints": 15},
        // ... more criteria
      ]
    }
    ```
    """
    response = llm.invoke(prompt)
    try:
        rubric = json.loads(response.content)
        # Add schema validation here using jsonschema if needed
        return {"rubric": rubric}
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error parsing rubric JSON: {e}")
        print(f"LLM Response: {response.content}")  # Log for debugging
        return {"rubric": {}} # Or raise an exception, depending on error handling strategy.
```

By implementing these changes, the `rubric_extraction` function would more reliably produce a structured rubric suitable for automated scoring, significantly improving its overall score.


The provided code implements a Java code evaluation system using Langchain and Anthropic's Claude.  Let's evaluate it according to the rubric you provided.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompts within the `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`, and `marks_extraction` functions are reasonably well-structured. They clearly present the Java code, the rubric, and any previous evaluations to the LLM.  However, they could be improved.  There's no explicit instruction on the *format* of the expected JSON output, which might lead to inconsistencies.  Adding examples of the desired JSON structure in the prompts would enhance clarity and improve consistency.  Therefore, I'd rate this as **2 marks**.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `safe_eval` function attempts to handle different output formats (literal eval, JSON). This is good defensive programming. However,  it relies on the LLM consistently returning valid JSON or literal expressions.  If the LLM's response is malformed, the error handling might not be robust enough (a more specific `try...except` block for each type of parsing error would be beneficial). Given the potential for failure despite the error handling, I give this a score of **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `State` TypedDict effectively manages the state, storing the code, rubric, evaluations, and marks. The graph structure ensures that information flows correctly between nodes.  This earns **1 mark**.


**Total for Initial Evaluation Method: 4 / 6**

**Overall Comments:**

The code has a good structure using a state graph to manage the evaluation process.  The use of Langchain and Anthropic's LLM is appropriate for this task.  However, the reliance on the LLM to produce perfectly formatted JSON is a weakness.  The system would benefit from more robust error handling and input validation to deal with unexpected LLM outputs.  Adding input validation to the Java code itself (to prevent malicious code execution) is crucial and missing.   Consider adding more explicit instructions and examples to the prompts to guide the LLM towards the desired output format.  Finally, providing a way for a human to review and correct the LLM's evaluation would make the system more reliable.  Adding a mechanism to record the timestamps of each step is also useful.


The provided code implements a Java code evaluation system using a LangChain-based graph and the Anthropic Claude LLM. Let's evaluate Module 6, focusing on the `review_evaluation` function and its impact on the rubric's "Review Evaluation Method" section.

**4. Review Evaluation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in the `review_evaluation` function is reasonably well-structured. It clearly instructs the LLM to review and refine the initial evaluation, providing the code, rubric, and initial evaluation as context.  It requests a refined evaluation in the same structure.  However, it could be improved by explicitly stating the desired format for the output (e.g., "a JSON object with keys matching the rubric criteria") to minimize ambiguity and parsing errors.  Therefore, I'll award **2 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The function uses `safe_eval` to handle potential JSON or literal eval parsing of the LLM's response. This is a good approach to handle varied output formats from the LLM. However, error handling could be more robust; currently it defaults to an empty dictionary upon failure, which might mask crucial errors in the LLM's response.  It successfully extracts the refined evaluation. Therefore, I'll give **2 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `review_evaluation` function correctly updates the `review_evaluation` key in the `state` dictionary. This ensures the refined evaluation is saved for further processing (marks extraction).  **1 mark**.

**Overall Score for Review Evaluation Method: 5 / 6**

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Prompt Enhancement:**  Add explicit instructions on the expected JSON structure of the output in the `review_evaluation` prompt. This reduces the ambiguity and improves the reliability of parsing.  For example:

   ```
   Return the refined evaluation as a JSON object.  The JSON object should have the same keys as the initial evaluation, and each key should map to a string value describing the refined evaluation for that criterion.
   ```

2. **Robust Error Handling:**  Improve the `safe_eval` function. Instead of silently returning an empty dictionary, log the error and raise a more informative exception. This will help debug issues where the LLM's response is not parsable.

3. **Schema Validation:** Consider adding a schema validation step after parsing the LLM's response to ensure the output conforms to the expected structure. This will add another layer of error detection and correction.

4. **LLM Response Handling:**  The code currently doesn't handle the possibility of the LLM returning an invalid JSON or unexpected data. Adding checks to ensure the response is in the expected format would make the system more robust.

5. **Unit Tests:** Adding unit tests would significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the code. This would allow for automated checking of the `safe_eval` function and prompt handling.


By addressing these points, the code's robustness and the accuracy of the evaluation process can be significantly improved.  The prompt design, while functional, lacks the precision needed for consistent high-quality output from the LLM. The parsing is adequate but could benefit from more robust error handling and schema validation.  State saving is correctly implemented.


The provided code implements a Java code evaluation system using a LangChain graph and Anthropic's Claude model. Let's analyze the `marks_extraction` function and its associated rubric criteria.

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in `marks_extraction` is quite good. It clearly instructs the LLM to assign marks based on the provided rubric and reviewed evaluation. It also specifies that marks should not exceed the maximum points.  This is complete and effective, so **3 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The function uses `safe_eval` to handle both JSON and literal_eval outputs. This is a good approach to handle potential variations in the LLM's response format. Assuming the LLM consistently returns a JSON-like structure mirroring the rubric, the extraction should be complete. Therefore, **2 marks**.  However, robustness could be improved by adding more specific error handling for malformed JSON or unexpected data types from the LLM.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The extracted marks are correctly saved into the `state['marks']` dictionary. This is then used for the total marks calculation.  **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Module 7 (Marks Extraction): 6 / 6**

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Error Handling:**  While `safe_eval` is a good start, adding more robust error handling within `marks_extraction` would make it more resilient.  For example, check if the returned `marks` dictionary has the expected keys and that the values are numbers within the allowed range. Log errors or raise exceptions for easier debugging.

* **Schema Validation:**  Consider using a schema validation library (like `jsonschema`) to formally verify the structure and data types of the LLM's response. This would add a layer of security and ensure data consistency.

* **Prompt Engineering:** Experiment with different prompt phrasing to potentially improve the accuracy and consistency of the LLM's mark assignments.  For example, providing example mark assignments in the prompt might be beneficial.

* **Unit Tests:**  Adding unit tests would help ensure the reliability and correctness of the `marks_extraction` function and its interaction with the LLM.  This could involve mocking the LLM response to test different scenarios (correct response, incorrect response, missing data, etc.).


The code is well-structured and utilizes error handling to mitigate potential issues. With a few additions to improve error handling and robustness, it should perform well.


The provided code uses a Langchain-based approach to evaluate Java code. Let's analyze its `total_marks_calculation` function and how it relates to the rubric.

**Total Marks Calculation Method Assessment:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The `total_marks_calculation` function itself doesn't involve a prompt. The prompt design is handled in the `marks_extraction` function, which asks the LLM to assign marks based on a review.  This is indirect but effective in getting the marks needed for the total calculation. Therefore, it gets a **3/3**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The function directly sums the values from `state['marks']`. Assuming `marks_extraction` correctly generates a dictionary where keys represent criteria and values are numerical marks,  `sum(state['marks'].values())` correctly extracts the total. This gets a **2/2**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The total is correctly saved into `state['total_marks']`. This receives a **1/1**.


**Overall Score for Module 8, Item 6:** 6/6

**Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling within `total_marks_calculation`.  What happens if `state['marks']` is not a dictionary, contains non-numeric values, or is empty?  Adding a `try-except` block would improve robustness.  For example:

```python
def total_marks_calculation(state: State):
    try:
        total = sum(float(mark) for mark in state['marks'].values()) # added float conversion for safety
        return {"total_marks": total}
    except (KeyError, TypeError, ValueError) as e:
        print(f"Error calculating total marks: {e}")
        return {"total_marks": 0.0} # or raise the exception depending on desired behavior
```

* **Rubric Validation:**  The rubric's structure isn't explicitly validated.  There's an assumption that `marks_extraction` produces a correctly formatted dictionary matching the rubric's structure. Adding validation would prevent unexpected errors.

* **Clarity of `marks_extraction` Prompt:** While the `marks_extraction` prompt is functional, it could benefit from stricter instructions on the expected output format to minimize ambiguity for the LLM.


In summary, the code functions correctly for the total marks calculation based on the assumptions about the preceding functions. However, adding the suggested improvements would enhance its reliability and robustness.


The provided code demonstrates a good attempt at creating a LangGraph for Java code evaluation. Let's assess it based on the rubric:

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The code correctly adds all the necessary nodes (`extract_classes`, `extract_rubric`, `evaluate_initially`, `review_eval`, `extract_marks`, `calculate_total_marks`) to the `graph_builder`.  **5 marks**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code also correctly adds edges to define the workflow. The sequence `START -> extract_classes -> extract_rubric -> evaluate_initially -> review_eval -> extract_marks -> calculate_total_marks -> END` is accurately represented. **5 marks**

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The line `graph = graph_builder.compile()` attempts to compile the graph.  Assuming `graph_builder.compile()` functions correctly within the `langgraph` library (which is not included here for direct verification), this step is also correct. **4 marks**


**Total: 14 / 14**

The code is well-structured and clearly shows the intended flow.  The use of `TypedDict` for the `State` enhances readability and type safety.  The error handling with `try-except` blocks in the main loop is a good addition.  The use of `safe_eval` to handle different response formats from the LLM is also prudent.


**Recommendations:**

* **Include `langgraph` Library:** The provided notebook is incomplete without the `langgraph` library code.  It's impossible to definitively assess the correctness of the compilation without seeing that library's implementation.  This is crucial for a complete evaluation.

* **Input Validation:** Add more robust input validation for the Java code.  Currently, it only checks for the "quit" command and empty input.  It should handle syntax errors or other invalid inputs gracefully.

* **More Sophisticated Error Handling:** The `try-except` block catches all exceptions (`Exception as e`). While this prevents crashes, it's better to catch more specific exceptions (e.g., `LLMError`, `ValueError`, `json.JSONDecodeError`) for more informative error messages.

* **Unit Tests:**  Adding unit tests to verify the individual functions (e.g., `class_extraction`, `rubric_extraction`) would significantly improve the code's reliability and maintainability.

* **Documentation:**  Adding more detailed comments to explain the purpose and functionality of different functions would improve understanding.

In summary, based on the visible code, the graph construction is perfect.  However, a complete evaluation requires the `langgraph` library and more thorough testing.


This Jupyter Notebook outlines a system for automatically evaluating Java code using a large language model (LLM) and a state graph.  Here's a breakdown of the code, potential improvements, and considerations:

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Setup and Dependencies:** The notebook begins by installing `python-dotenv` (for environment variables), importing necessary libraries (including `langchain` for LLM interaction and `langgraph` for graph-based workflow management), and loading environment variables from a `.env` file.  Crucially, it checks for the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and exits if it's not found.

2. **`State` Definition:** A `TypedDict` called `State` is defined to hold the intermediate data during the evaluation process.  This includes the LLM messages, Java code, extracted classes, rubric, evaluations, marks, and the total marks.

3. **LLM Initialization:** An Anthropic Chat LLM (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`) is initialized.  Note that the specific model and API key are crucial for execution.

4. **Helper Functions:** Several functions are defined to handle tasks like:
    * `safe_eval`: Safely evaluates JSON or literal string representations of dictionaries.  Handles potential errors gracefully.
    * `class_extraction`: Extracts class names from Java code using the LLM.
    * `rubric_extraction`: Generates a rubric for Java code evaluation using the LLM.
    * `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`:  Perform initial and reviewed evaluations of the Java code based on the rubric, using the LLM.
    * `marks_extraction`: Assigns marks based on the reviewed evaluation and rubric.
    * `total_marks_calculation`: Calculates the total marks.

5. **State Graph Construction:** A `StateGraph` is created and nodes (functions) and edges (dependencies) are added to define the workflow.  The graph dictates the order of execution of the evaluation steps.

6. **Graph Compilation and Main Loop:** The graph is compiled, and a main loop allows the user to repeatedly input Java code for evaluation. The loop continues until the user enters "quit".  The graph's `stream` function executes the evaluation process step-by-step, printing the intermediate results and final total marks.  Error handling is included to catch exceptions during LLM interaction or other processing.


**Potential Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** While the code includes some error handling, more robust mechanisms could be added.  For instance, it might be useful to handle cases where the LLM returns unexpected output formats or fails to produce valid JSON.  More specific exception types could be caught and handled individually.

* **Input Validation:**  The Java code input is not validated. Adding validation could prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.  A simple check for syntax errors might be beneficial.

* **Rubric Customization:** The rubric is currently hardcoded in the prompt for `rubric_extraction`.  Allowing users to provide their own rubric or select from pre-defined rubrics would increase flexibility.

* **LLM Prompt Engineering:** The prompts used for each LLM call could be further refined for clarity and to elicit more accurate and consistent responses.  Experimentation with different prompt phrasing is recommended.

* **Logging:**  Adding logging would be helpful for debugging and monitoring the system's performance.

* **Unit Tests:**  Writing unit tests for the individual functions would improve the code's reliability and maintainability.

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Using asynchronous operations could speed up the overall evaluation process, particularly when interacting with the LLM.

* **Code Formatting:**  The Java code is not formatted before being sent to the LLM. Formatting could improve the LLM's ability to understand and evaluate the code.


**To Run the Notebook:**

1.  **Install dependencies:** `pip install python-dotenv langchain langgraph langchain-anthropic`
2.  **Obtain an Anthropic API key:**  Sign up for an Anthropic account and obtain an API key.
3.  **Create a `.env` file:**  Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as the notebook and add the following line, replacing `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
4.  **Run the notebook:** Execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook.


Remember to replace `"claude-3-haiku-20240307"` with the actual model name if you use a different Anthropic model.  The `safe_eval` function is crucial due to the inherent unpredictability of LLM output; always sanitize and validate data from LLMs before use in production systems.
