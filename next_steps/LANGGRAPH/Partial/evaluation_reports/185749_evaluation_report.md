## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [2/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract class names and code but lacks precision. It doesn't explicitly define the expected JSON structure, leading to parsing errors.  The prompt should include a more detailed example of the desired output format.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student attempts to parse the LLM's response as JSON, showing understanding of the task. However, the error "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" indicates the LLM response was not valid JSON, leading to failure in parsing.  This is likely due to the imprecise prompt.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes were not properly saved to the state.  The code includes an attempt, but the parsing failure prevented successful state updating.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No rubric extraction method was implemented.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**

No state saving for review evaluation was implemented.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks extraction method was implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks extraction was attempted.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for marks extraction was implemented.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [2/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The `sum_marks` function is correctly implemented but not integrated into the LLM workflow because marks were not extracted.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The `sum_marks` function correctly parses and sums a comma-separated list of marks if provided.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The total marks were not saved due to the lack of marks extraction.


#### 7. Graph Construction [8/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The student successfully added some nodes to the LangGraph. However, several nodes required for a complete solution are missing.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [3/5]:**  
Some edges were correctly defined connecting the existing nodes.  However, many connections are missing due to the missing modules.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compilation was successful given the incomplete graph.



---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated some understanding of LangGraph by creating a basic workflow and implementing a `sum_marks` tool.  However, crucial modules (rubric extraction, initial and review evaluation, marks extraction) were missing.  Focus on improving prompt design for clear and specific instructions to the LLM, and ensure each module is fully implemented and integrated into the LangGraph workflow.


Based on the provided rubric and code, here's a mark breakdown for Module 1.  The scoring is strict and only awards points for correctly implemented features according to the specifications.  Compilation errors are not considered, as stated in the rubric.

**Total Marks: 25/50**


**Breakdown:**

* **1. Class Extraction Module (10 marks): 0/10**

   - The code attempts to extract classes using an LLM. However, the JSON parsing fails due to an improperly formatted LLM response.  The `json.loads` call throws an error, indicating a failure in this crucial step.  No classes are successfully extracted into the state.

* **2. Rubric Extraction Module (10 marks): 0/10**

   - This module depends on the successful output of the Class Extraction Module. Since the Class Extraction module fails, this module also fails.  The JSON decoding error prevents successful extraction of rubric details.

* **3. Initial Evaluation Module (10 marks): 5/10**

    - The initial evaluation node successfully invokes the LLM.  However, because the previous modules failed, the input to this module is incomplete and invalid.  The LLM prompt is formed correctly, but the response it receives is used improperly and does not directly provide the required numeric scores and comments (as per the rubric).  Partial credit is given for LLM invocation.


* **4. Review Evaluation Module (10 marks): 0/10**

   - This module also depends on the output of the Initial Evaluation Module and therefore fails. The `'str' object has no attribute 'items'` error indicates that `state['evaluation']` is a string, not a dictionary as expected, leading to a failure in the iteration.

* **5. Marks Extraction Module (10 marks): 0/10**

   - This module depends on the Review Evaluation Module and therefore fails.  The error message  `"Error: 'final_evaluation' key does not exist in the state"` clearly shows this module fails because the preceding module did not populate the `final_evaluation` key.

* **6. Total Marks Calculation Module (0 marks): 0/0**

   - This module depends entirely on previous steps and is not evaluated because the other modules failed.


**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling around LLM invocations and JSON parsing.  It should include more comprehensive `try-except` blocks to catch specific exceptions and handle them gracefully (e.g., retrying LLM calls, providing default values, or logging detailed error messages).

2. **Input Validation:** Add input validation to check the format of the LLM responses before attempting to parse them as JSON. This would prevent crashes due to unexpected output from the LLM.

3. **Debugging:** The print statements are helpful for debugging, but better logging mechanisms (using a logging library) would improve maintainability and readability, particularly in a production environment.

4. **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompts to ensure the LLM responses consistently provide the data in the expected format.  Clear and unambiguous instructions for the LLM are crucial for reliable results.


The student should focus on improving the robustness of their code and the clarity of their LLM prompts to achieve higher marks in subsequent modules.


### RUBRIC MODULE: Module 2 - Evaluation

This evaluation strictly follows the provided rubric and does not hallucinate information.  The student's code has several critical flaws preventing successful execution and thus earning full marks in several sections.

**1. Downloading Packages and Setting API Keys (5 marks):**

* **Score: 5/5**  The code correctly installs necessary packages and prompts for the OpenAI API key.

**2. Preparing Input Data (5 marks):**

* **Score: 5/5** The code correctly reads the content of the four `.md` files (`question.md`, `model_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `student_solution.md`).  The rubric assumes these files exist in the same directory.

**3. Initializing State Objects (5 marks):**

* **Score: 5/5** The `state` dictionary is correctly initialized with the file contents and other necessary keys.

**4. Building and Compiling the Workflow (15 marks):**  This section is broken down by module.

**4.1 Class Extraction Module (5 marks):**

* **Score: 0/5**  The `class_extraction_node` function attempts to use an LLM to extract classes. However, the JSON parsing fails due to an improperly formatted LLM response. The error message "Error in class_extraction_node: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" clearly indicates this.  The code lacks error handling to gracefully manage this failure.  No classes are extracted.

**4.2 Rubric Extraction Module (5 marks):**

* **Score: 0/5** The `rubric_extraction_node` function depends on the output of the `class_extraction_node`. Since that fails, this node also fails. Additionally, even if `class_extraction_node` worked, error handling for JSON decoding is insufficient.  The code assumes the LLM always returns valid JSON, which is not a safe assumption.  No rubric details are extracted.

**4.3 Initial Evaluation Module (5 marks):**

* **Score: 0/5** The `initial_evaluation_node` depends on the output from the previous two modules. Due to their failures, this module also fails to produce a meaningful evaluation.

**4.4 Review Evaluation Module (5 marks):**

* **Score: 0/5** This module depends on the output of `initial_evaluation_node`, which has failed.  Additionally, it attempts to iterate over  `state['evaluation'].items()`, which is incorrect if `state['evaluation']` is a string (as indicated by the error message 'str' object has no attribute 'items'). No review is performed.

**4.5 Marks Extraction Module (5 marks):**

* **Score: 0/5** This module depends on the `final_evaluation` from the previous step.  The failure of the previous nodes means this node fails.  The code also lacks error handling for the situation where `'final_evaluation'` is not in the state dictionary.

**4.6 Total Marks Calculation Module (5 marks):**

* **Score: 0/5** This module depends on the successful execution of `marks_extraction_node`. Due to the earlier failures, `state['marks']` is not set and leads to an error.


**5. Final Workflow (5 marks):**

* **Score: 5/5** The workflow graph is correctly defined and compiled.  The visual representation of the workflow is correctly generated.  However, since the individual nodes fail, the workflow's execution also fails.


**Total Score: 20/40**

**Feedback:**

The main issue is the inadequate error handling and the dependence of later stages on the successful execution of earlier stages. The code needs robust error handling mechanisms to catch exceptions from the LLM, JSON parsing errors, and missing keys in the `state` dictionary. Each node should be designed to handle potential failures gracefully, either by providing default values or logging detailed error messages. The prompt engineering to the LLM also needs to be refined to ensure consistently structured and valid JSON responses.  The LLM calls are very naive, assuming that the output will always be correctly formatted.   Testing the individual components independently before integrating them into the workflow is crucial for debugging and identifying these problems early on.


Here's an evaluation of the provided Jupyter Notebook code based on the given rubric.  The evaluation focuses on Module 3, the Class Extraction Module.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt is designed to extract Java classes from both student and model solutions. However, it has some weaknesses:

    * **Ambiguity:** The prompt states, "Provide the results as JSON with keys 'student_code_classes' and 'model_code_classes', each containing a list of dictionaries with 'class_name' and 'class_code'." While intending to be clear, it could benefit from a more structured example. Showing a JSON example of the desired output would reduce the ambiguity and chances of misinterpretation by the LLM.

    * **Robustness:**  The prompt doesn't account for edge cases, such as code with no classes, invalid Java code, or multiple classes within the same file with the same name. A more robust prompt would explicitly handle these cases, perhaps instructing the LLM to return an empty list or to indicate errors appropriately.

    * **Code Formatting:** It directly embeds the code into the prompt.  While this works, it's not ideal, especially with large code snippets. For improved clarity and easier handling by the LLM, it would be better to provide the code separately as a parameter.

    **Score: 2 marks** (The prompt attempts to provide the necessary input elements but falls short in clarity and robustness.)


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to parse the LLM's JSON response. However, the error handling is not sufficient:

    * **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` block catches a general `Exception`. This is too broad and masks potential issues like invalid JSON format, which are highly probable with LLM responses. A more specific `json.JSONDecodeError` exception should be handled separately to gracefully manage incorrect JSON structures. The current error "Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" clearly indicates that the response from the LLM isn't valid JSON as expected, and it should be handled more effectively (maybe by retrying with a modified prompt or providing a default value).

    * **Unexpected Output:** The LLM output isn't consistently JSON. The `json.loads()` call fails because the LLM sometimes produces plain text explanations instead of JSON. The code needs to check the response format before attempting parsing.

    **Score: 0 marks** (Parsing is ineffective due to poor error handling and a failure to anticipate varying LLM output formats.)


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves extracted class information to `state['student_classes']` and `state['model_classes']`.

    **Score: 1 mark**


**Overall Module 3 Score: 3 marks (2 + 0 + 1)**


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Refined Prompt:** Use a more structured prompt with a JSON example and instructions for handling edge cases (e.g., no classes found, invalid code). Separate the code from the prompt and pass it as arguments to the function.

2. **Robust Parsing:** Implement comprehensive error handling, specifically for `json.JSONDecodeError`. Add checks to determine if the LLM response is in JSON format before parsing and handle cases where it's not (e.g., provide a default value or retry the request with a modified prompt).

3. **Logging:** Include more detailed logging to track the LLM's responses and any errors encountered during processing. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the reasons for failures.

4. **Input Validation:** Add input validation to check that the student and model code are in the expected format (Java code) before passing them to the LLM.


By addressing these issues, the robustness and reliability of the class extraction module can be significantly improved.  The current implementation is too fragile to be considered a reliable part of an automated assessment system.


Let's evaluate the provided code against the rubric.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The prompt in `rubric_extraction_node` is weak. It simply asks the LLM to "extract the relevant rubric details for evaluation" without providing specific instructions on *how* to map rubric criteria to each class.  The prompt lacks crucial information. It doesn't specify the format of the expected output (e.g., JSON, a structured table), nor does it define what "relevant" means. This could lead to inconsistent and unreliable results. A rubric might have general and specific criteria.  The prompt needs to instruct the LLM to identify which criteria apply to each class.  This receives a **1 mark**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The code attempts to parse the LLM's response as JSON using `json.loads()`. However, the error handling (`except json.JSONDecodeError`) is insufficient.  The LLM might return unstructured text, and the code doesn't handle that case.  The LLM response is printed for debugging, but a robust solution would involve more sophisticated parsing techniques (regular expressions or more structured prompts). The code fails gracefully in case of an error, but it doesn't attempt alternative parsing methods if JSON parsing fails. This results in a **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):**

The rubric details are saved to the `state['rubric']` variable.  However, the JSON decoding error will often mean the update fails. While the *intention* is correct, the unreliable parsing causes improper storage. The solution does not guarantee correct saving of rubric details. This receives a **0 marks**.


**Overall score for Extract Rubric Method:** 1 + 1 + 0 = **2 marks out of 6**

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Refined Prompt Engineering:**  The prompt for rubric extraction needs significant revision. It should:
    * Explicitly state the expected output format (e.g., JSON).
    * Define "relevant rubric details" more precisely.  Provide examples if possible.
    * Instruct the LLM to analyze each class individually, identifying and extracting the applicable rubric criteria for that class.
    * Include example mappings of classes to rubric criteria.

2. **Robust Parsing:** The code should include more robust error handling and parsing logic:
    * Handle cases where the LLM response is not valid JSON.  Use techniques like regular expressions to extract key information even from unstructured text.
    * Implement better error recovery. Log errors and potentially retry with improved prompts or use fallback mechanisms.

3. **Input Validation:** The code assumes the presence of `state['student_classes']`.  It needs to check if this list is empty before invoking the LLM.


**Example of Improved `rubric_extraction_node`:**

```python
def rubric_extraction_node(state: EvaluationState):
    model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
    
    if not state['student_classes']:
        print("Warning: No student classes found. Skipping rubric extraction.")
        return state

    prompt = f"""
    Extract relevant rubric details for each class in the student's code. The rubric is provided below.
    For each class, identify which criteria from the rubric apply. Provide the output as JSON.

    Classes:
    {json.dumps([cls['class_name'] for cls in state['student_classes']])}

    Rubric:
    {state['rubric']}

    Example Output (JSON):
    {{
        "ClassName1": [{"criterion": "Criterion A", "weight": 0.2}, {"criterion": "Criterion B", "weight": 0.8}],
        "ClassName2": [{"criterion": "Criterion C", "weight": 0.5}, {"criterion": "Criterion D", "weight": 0.5}]
    }}
    """
    try:
        response = model.invoke([prompt])
        print("Rubric Extraction LLM Response Content:", response.content)
        state['rubric'] = json.loads(response.content)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding JSON from rubric extraction: {e}. Attempting alternative parsing...")
        # Add alternative parsing logic here (e.g., using regular expressions)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in rubric_extraction_node: {e}")
    return state
```

This improved version addresses the issues mentioned above.  Remember to add appropriate alternative parsing if JSON parsing fails.  The use of JSON in the prompt and expected output makes it more structured and easier to process.  The example output in the prompt guides the LLM towards the desired format and content.


Based on the provided code and the rubric, here's an evaluation of Module 5:


**3. Initial Evaluation Method**

* **Prompt Design (1 mark):** The prompts are designed to extract classes, rubric details, and perform an evaluation. However, they are not properly structured for accurate assessment in all cases. The prompts heavily rely on the LLM's ability to understand and interpret unstructured information (like the rubric content) which is prone to errors and inconsistencies.  A more structured prompt design, perhaps specifying the format of the expected JSON or dict outputs, would be necessary for more reliable results.  The prompts also lack specific criteria for scoring, leaving the evaluation open to interpretation by the LLM.  This significantly impacts the accuracy of the evaluation.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** The code attempts to extract scores and comments, but fails consistently due to issues with the LLM response format and prompt design. The `json.loads` call fails frequently because the LLM responses are not always in the expected JSON format.  No robust error handling or alternative parsing strategies are implemented to address this critical issue. The code doesn't reliably extract numeric scores.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The state object is correctly defined and populated, and the state is passed between nodes.  This part of the module functions as intended.


**Overall Score for Initial Evaluation Method: 2 / 6**

**Reasons for Low Score:**

The major weakness lies in the interaction between the prompts and the LLM.  The prompts are too open-ended and fail to constrain the LLM's output to a format easily parsable by the code.  The resulting inconsistencies in the LLM's responses lead to parsing errors and a lack of reliable score extraction.   The error handling is also insufficient; a more robust approach is needed to gracefully handle unpredictable LLM responses.  The lack of structured feedback and explicit scoring criteria in the prompts further hinders the accuracy of the evaluation. To improve this module, the following changes should be made:

* **Structured Prompts:** Design prompts that explicitly define the expected output format (e.g., JSON with specific keys and data types). Provide examples of the desired format.
* **Clear Rubric Representation:** The rubric should be structured (e.g., as a JSON or a table) rather than as free-form text to ensure consistent LLM interpretation.
* **Explicit Scoring Criteria:**  The prompts should contain specific scoring instructions for each rubric criterion.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling to manage cases where the LLM's response is not in the expected format. This could include alternative parsing strategies or fallback mechanisms.
* **Testing and Refinement:** Thoroughly test the module with different student code examples to identify and address weaknesses in the prompt design and response parsing.


The current implementation demonstrates a conceptual understanding of using LLMs for automated grading, but it falls short in terms of robustness and reliability. The critical failure to parse the LLM's output effectively renders the entire evaluation process unreliable.


The provided code attempts to build a Langchain workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's assess Module 6 (Review Evaluation Method) according to the rubric.

**4. Review Evaluation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (1 mark):** The prompt in `review_evaluation_node` is weak. It simply asks the LLM to "Review the initial evaluation...and make corrections if needed," without providing context (the question, the student's solution, the model solution, or the rubric).  A good prompt would explicitly include all relevant information for the LLM to perform a thorough review. This is a significant shortcoming.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** The code assumes the initial evaluation (`state['evaluation']`) is a dictionary where keys are class names and values are evaluation content.  However, the `initial_evaluation_node` doesn't produce such a dictionary.  It outputs a single string, causing the `items()` call in `review_evaluation_node` to fail. The code lacks proper error handling and doesn't correctly extract or handle the LLM's output from the review process.

* **State Saving (0 marks):**  While `state['final_evaluation']` is intended to save the reviewed evaluation, the extraction failure means it's not correctly populated.  The code doesn't reliably save the reviewed evaluation for later use.


**Overall Module 6 Score: 1 / 6**

**Reasons for Low Score and Improvements:**

The major issue is the lack of well-defined data structures and insufficient error handling. The prompts aren't well-structured enough to guide the LLM effectively.  Here's how to improve:

1. **Improved Prompt Design:**  The prompts for all nodes, especially `initial_evaluation_node` and `review_evaluation_node`, need significant revision. The prompts should:

    * **Include all relevant information:**  Provide the question, student solution, model solution, and relevant rubric sections.  Structure the prompt clearly, specifying what kind of response is expected (e.g., JSON for structured data).

    * **Be specific:** Instead of vague requests like "make corrections," specify exactly what aspects to review (e.g., correctness of code, adherence to rubric criteria, code style).


2. **Robust Parsing and Output Extraction:**

    * **Expected Output Structure:** Define clearly the expected output structure (e.g., JSON) from both the `initial_evaluation_node` and `review_evaluation_node`.

    * **Error Handling:** Implement proper exception handling (using `try...except` blocks) to catch errors during JSON parsing and LLM interactions.  Handle cases where the LLM might not provide a response or provide an unexpected format.

    * **Data Validation:** Add checks to ensure that the data extracted from the LLM is in the expected format and contains the required information.


3. **Reliable State Saving:**  Modify the `review_evaluation_node` to handle the corrected evaluations, ensuring that they are saved correctly in the `state` dictionary.  Consider using a more robust data structure (like a dictionary) to store the evaluations, making it easier to access and process them in the subsequent nodes.


4. **Code Structure:** The code has some parts that could be improved in readability. Use more descriptive variable names, add comments explaining complex logic, and possibly split larger functions into smaller, more manageable ones (for better maintainability).

By addressing these points, the code's reliability and the Module 6 score can be substantially improved.  The current implementation has fundamental flaws preventing accurate evaluation and state management.


Based on the provided code and the rubric, here's an evaluation of the "Marks Extraction Method" module:

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt in `marks_extraction_node` is mostly effective (**2 marks**).  While it attempts to extract comma-separated numeric scores, it relies heavily on the LLM's ability to correctly interpret the free-form text of `final_evaluation`.  A more robust approach would involve structuring the `final_evaluation` to include specific score fields for each criterion, making the extraction less reliant on natural language understanding. The current design is vulnerable to variations in the LLM's output formatting.  A better prompt would specify the expected format explicitly (e.g., "Return a JSON object with class names as keys and a list of comma-separated scores as values").

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to extract marks using `response.content.strip()`, but it fails because `final_evaluation` is not properly populated due to earlier errors.  This results in partial extraction (**1 mark**). The `','.join(marks)` part correctly formats the output *if* the individual class marks are extracted.

* **State Saving (1 mark):**  The state saving of marks (`state['marks'] = ','.join(marks)`) is correctly implemented assuming successful extraction. (**1 mark**)


**Total Marks for Marks Extraction Method: 4 / 6**

**Reasons for deductions:**

* The main issue lies in the prompt design's reliance on unstructured LLM output for extraction. This makes the method fragile.
* The earlier errors in the `rubric_extraction_node` and `review_evaluation_node` directly affect the `marks_extraction_node`'s ability to work correctly.  The error handling in these earlier nodes needs improvement.  The code should gracefully handle cases where the LLM response is not in the expected format or if a key is missing.  Consider using `try-except` blocks to catch `json.JSONDecodeError` and `KeyError` exceptions more effectively.


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Structured Output from LLM:**  Modify the prompts for `initial_evaluation_node` and `review_evaluation_node` to force a structured JSON output from the LLM. This JSON should contain class names as keys and a list of scores as values for each evaluation step.

2. **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling in all nodes, especially `rubric_extraction_node` and `review_evaluation_node`, to gracefully handle malformed LLM responses.  Log errors effectively for debugging.

3. **Input Validation:** Add input validation to the `sum_marks` function to handle cases where the input string is not correctly formatted (e.g., missing commas, non-numeric values).


By incorporating these improvements, the reliability and robustness of the "Marks Extraction Method" can be significantly enhanced.  The prompt design would achieve a full 3 marks, and parsing/output extraction would achieve 2 marks, leading to a higher overall score.


## Module 8 Rubric Assessment

Based on the provided code, here's an assessment using the Module 8 rubric:


**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The code uses the `sum_marks` tool to calculate the total marks.  The prompts within the `marks_extraction_node` and `total_marks_node` functions correctly utilize it.  However,  the prompts feeding into `marks_extraction_node` rely heavily on the LLM to extract numeric scores, which is brittle and might lead to inaccurate results if the LLM's output isn't perfectly formatted.  This makes the prompt design less robust than ideal.

    * **Score: 2 marks** (Mostly proper, minor gaps due to reliance on LLM parsing for numerical data extraction).


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `sum_marks` function correctly parses a comma-separated string of numbers.  However, the error handling within `marks_extraction_node` is incomplete. The node doesn't always successfully extract the marks, leading to a missing 'marks' key in the state, resulting in a `KeyError` in `total_marks_node`. This shows a failure in the extraction, hence a 0 score for this section.


    * **Score: 0 marks** (Incorrect or no extraction due to the `KeyError`)


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The final total is saved in the `total_marks` key within the `state` dictionary.  This is correct.

    * **Score: 1 mark** (State saved correctly).


**Total Score for Section 6: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 marks**


**Overall Feedback:**

The core idea of using `sum_marks` is sound, but the implementation has significant flaws. The major issue is the insufficient error handling and overly reliant nature of the prompt design within `marks_extraction_node`. This node is crucial for the entire process; if it fails, the total marks calculation fails.  The solution needs improved robustness in handling different LLM output formats and providing alternative ways to extract the numerical marks (e.g., more structured prompts or regular expressions to directly extract numbers from the LLM's response).  Proper error handling must also be implemented to manage situations where mark extraction fails.  Without a proper fix in the  `marks_extraction_node`, the whole process will not work reliably.


Let's evaluate the provided code against the rubric.

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The code correctly adds all six modules (`class_extraction`, `rubric_extraction`, `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`, `marks_extraction`, `total_marks`) as nodes to the `workflow` graph.  **5 marks**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code correctly adds edges to connect the nodes in the intended workflow sequence: START -> `class_extraction` -> `rubric_extraction` -> `initial_evaluation` -> `review_evaluation` -> `marks_extraction` -> `total_marks` -> END.  **5 marks**

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The graph is compiled using `app = workflow.compile()`. This appears to be the correct method call. However, the subsequent execution shows errors. The issues stem from problems within the node functions themselves, not the graph construction.  Therefore, I will award **2 marks** because the compilation *attempt* is correct, but it fails due to errors in the logic of the individual nodes.  The graph structure itself is sound.


**Total for Graph Construction: 12 / 14**


**Reasons for Deductions and Error Analysis:**

The primary reason for the deductions and the runtime errors is the handling of the LLM responses and the data within the `state` object.  Here's a breakdown:

1. **`class_extraction_node` Error:** The JSON parsing in `class_extraction_node` fails. The output from the LLM is not valid JSON (it contains a large text response that isn't formatted as JSON). The code should handle this possibility more robustly, perhaps by checking if the response is JSON before trying to parse it and using error handling.

2. **`rubric_extraction_node` Error:** This node also fails because the output from `initial_evaluation_node` isn't valid JSON.  Again, robust error handling is missing. The node assumes that the LLM will always return a JSON, which is not true based on the output.

3. **`review_evaluation_node` Error:**  This node attempts to iterate over `state['evaluation'].items()`.  However, `state['evaluation']` is a string (the raw LLM output) and doesn't have an `items()` method. The LLM response needs to be parsed (likely into a dictionary) to extract individual class evaluations.

4. **`marks_extraction_node` Error:** This node depends on `'final_evaluation'` being in the `state` and `state['marks']` existing before it can calculate total marks. Due to the errors in previous nodes, this does not occur.


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

* **Robust Error Handling:** Add `try-except` blocks around all LLM calls and JSON parsing attempts.  Handle potential exceptions (like `json.JSONDecodeError`, `OpenAIError`) gracefully.  Log errors to help debug.

* **Response Validation:**  Before attempting to parse the LLM response as JSON, check its structure. Print or log the raw LLM response to understand its format.  The response should be analyzed to extract necessary data rather than blindly assuming JSON format.

* **Data Structure Consistency:** Ensure that data stored in the `state` object is consistently typed.  If a node expects a dictionary, ensure the previous node produces a dictionary.  Add type hints (`from typing import Dict, List`) to improve code clarity and help catch type errors.

* **LLM Prompt Refinement:** The prompts to the LLM need to be carefully designed to ensure clear, well-structured JSON responses.  Provide clear instructions and examples of the expected output format within the prompt.


By addressing these issues, the code will execute correctly and achieve a much higher score on the rubric.  The core graph structure is well-designed; it's the internal node logic that needs significant revision.


The notebook has several issues preventing it from running correctly.  The primary problems are:

1. **Error Handling and JSON Parsing:** The `class_extraction_node` and `rubric_extraction_node` functions attempt to parse JSON responses from the LLM, but they don't handle the cases where the LLM's response isn't valid JSON. The `try...except` blocks are insufficient;  they only catch general `Exception`s, and the `json.JSONDecodeError` is not properly handled in `rubric_extraction_node`.  The LLM might return an error message or a string that isn't formatted as JSON, which causes the JSON decoder to fail.  These errors need more robust handling, perhaps by checking the response structure before attempting parsing.

2. **Incorrect Response Handling:** The `initial_evaluation_node` function assumes the LLM response will be a dictionary, but the LLM output is a string.  It should parse the response more carefully to extract the relevant information (score and comments).

3. **`final_evaluation` Structure:** The `review_evaluation_node` tries to iterate through `state['evaluation']` with `.items()`, but `state['evaluation']` is a simple string, not a dictionary.  The LLM response needs to be processed to create a dictionary of class names and their evaluations before this node can function correctly.

4. **Missing `marks` key:**  The `total_marks_node` fails because the `marks` key is not reliably populated in the `state` dictionary by `marks_extraction_node`. The `marks_extraction_node` depends on the successful execution of `review_evaluation_node`, which is failing due to the above-mentioned issues.

5. **Missing or Incorrect `question.md`, `model_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `student_solution.md` files:** The code assumes these files exist in the same directory.  Without these files, the notebook will fail.  You need to create these files with appropriate content for the code to work.  The `rubric.md` file is particularly crucial; its content needs to be structured in a way that the LLM can understand and extract relevant information.  A sample `rubric.md` might look like this:

   ```markdown

Remember to install the necessary packages and set your OpenAI API key.  The most important change is to consistently handle potential errors from the LLM and use `json.loads()` appropriately to convert JSON strings to Python dictionaries.  You'll also need to revise the later nodes to correctly process the dictionary structure of the evaluation results.  The use of `gpt-3.5-turbo` is also suggested as a more cost effective alternative to `gpt-4o` unless you have a specific need for the extra power of the latter.
