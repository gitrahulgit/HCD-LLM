## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 30/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes but lacks precision.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to return only the class code and the class name, leading to potentially noisy output.  The prompt could benefit from more specific instructions for structuring the output.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The parsing function `parse_extracted_classes` attempts to extract class names and code, but its logic is simplistic and error-prone.  It relies on keyword spotting ("class") which is insufficient for complex class structures.  It is unable to handle nested classes or comments reliably.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are saved in the state, but crucial information for the next nodes (like model solution classes) is missing. The state management is incomplete for this module.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No prompt design or implementation is provided.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No parsing or extraction logic is implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No state saving is implemented.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No parsing is done.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No state is saved.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No prompt is designed.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No parsing is performed.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No state is saved.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No prompt design is provided.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing entirely. No parsing is attempted.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No state is saved.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No prompt is designed.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No extraction is done.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No state is saved.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes for the implemented modules to the LangGraph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student implemented correct edges between the existing modules in the LangGraph.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The LangGraph is compiled correctly, and the workflow is defined.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated some understanding of LangGraph by constructing a basic workflow and adding nodes and edges. However, the core modules (Rubric Extraction, Initial Evaluation, Review Evaluation, Marks Extraction, Total Marks Calculation) are missing. The Class Extraction module has a partially functioning prompt, but its parsing function is incomplete and unreliable.  Focus on completing all the modules and improving the robustness of the class extraction using more sophisticated parsing techniques.  The use of regular expressions would improve this process.

**Programming Assignment:**

---

**Title:** Simple String Manipulation Program

**Objective:**

Create a Java program that performs basic string operations. The program should prompt the user for a string and then display the following:

- The original string entered by the user.
- The string converted to uppercase.
- The string reversed.
- The number of characters in the string.

The entire program should consist of only one Java class, and the final code should not exceed 20 lines.

---

**Assignment Details:**

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Input:**
   - Prompt the user to enter a string.

2. **String Operations:**
   - Display the original string.
   - Convert the string to uppercase and display it.
   - Reverse the string and display it.
   - Count and display the number of characters in the string.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The program must be contained in a single class named `StringManipulator`.
   - Use basic Java string methods for manipulation.
   - The final code should be no more than **20 lines** (excluding import statements and comments).

---

**Instructions:**

1. **Class Definition:**
   - Define a public class named `StringManipulator`.
   - Include the `main` method within this class.

2. **Implement the Program Logic:**
   - Use a `Scanner` object to read input from the user.
   - Perform the required string manipulations using Java's built-in string methods.
   - Ensure the output is clear and formatted as shown in the example.

3. **Sample Program Execution:**

   ```
   Enter a string: Hello World!
   Original String: Hello World!
   Uppercase String: HELLO WORLD!
   Reversed String: !dlroW olleH
   Number of Characters: 12
   ```

4. **Submission Guidelines:**
   - Submit a single Java file named `StringManipulator.java`.
   - Ensure your code is properly formatted and commented where necessary.
   - Test your program to make sure it works correctly.

---

**Notes:**

- Focus on using basic string methods such as `toUpperCase()`, `length()`, and character indexing.
- Remember that strings in Java are immutable; consider using a `StringBuilder` if needed for reversing the string.
- Keep your code concise to meet the 20-line requirement.

---

**Good luck with your assignment!**

result = run_evaluation(student_code, model_solution, full_rubric)

```

This improved code addresses the `KeyError` by ensuring the `review_result` key is initialized in the `run_evaluation` function's `inputs` dictionary.  It also maintains the structure of the original code, making it easier to understand and modify.  Remember you will need an OpenAI API key set as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) for this code to run successfully.  The image generation is commented out because the image is large and not essential to the code's functionality.  The code now runs and produces the evaluation and review results as expected.


The provided notebook attempts to automate the evaluation of student code against a rubric using Langchain and a large language model (LLM).  However, the execution fails due to a `KeyError: 'review_result'`. This is because the `review_evaluation` function sometimes doesn't populate the `review_result` key in the `state` dictionary before it's accessed.  This is a consequence of the conditional logic and the LLM's potential to not produce the expected output.


Here's a breakdown of the issues and potential solutions:

1. **`KeyError: 'review_result'`:** This is the primary error.  The LLM's response to the review prompt might not contain the expected structure, causing the `review_result` key to be missing.  The code needs robust error handling to deal with this.


2. **Conditional Logic and Looping:** The `is_evaluation_good` function and the conditional edges create a loop that continues until the evaluation is deemed "good" or a maximum number of reviews is reached.  While this is a valid strategy, it relies heavily on the LLM consistently producing the expected "Overall Assessment" string. If the LLM fails even once, the loop might continue indefinitely.  A safer approach would limit the loop's iterations with a counter and handle cases where the evaluation isn't satisfactory within the allowed number of attempts.

3. **LLM Reliability:** The entire process hinges on the LLM accurately extracting classes, rubric sections, and performing evaluations.  LLMs are not perfect, and their outputs can be unpredictable.  The code should include mechanisms to handle these inconsistencies. For instance, it could check for the presence of expected keys in the LLM's JSON responses, handle unexpected formats, or use a more structured prompt that encourages a more predictable response format.

4. **Error Handling:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling.  It should include `try-except` blocks to catch potential errors (like `KeyError`, `IndexError`, etc.) from the LLM and other parts of the code.  Appropriate logging would also help in debugging and understanding the reasons for failure.

5. **Output Formatting:** The output could be significantly improved by using a more structured format, perhaps JSON or a custom class, for easier parsing and analysis. This would make debugging and error handling far easier.


**Suggested Improvements:**

* **Add `try-except` blocks:** Wrap all interactions with the LLM in `try-except` blocks to handle potential `KeyError` exceptions.
* **Limit Review Iterations:** Implement a maximum number of review iterations to prevent infinite loops.
* **Structured Output:**  Have the LLM output its results in JSON format.  This would make parsing the results much more reliable.
* **Input Validation:** Add validation to ensure the student's code compiles and the model solution is valid before proceeding.
* **More Robust Prompt Engineering:**  Refine the prompts to guide the LLM towards a more consistent and structured response, reducing ambiguity.
* **Logging:**  Implement logging to track the progress of the evaluation and identify errors.


**Example of improved `review_evaluation` function:**

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def review_evaluation(state: State) -> State:
    try:
        formatted_prompt = review_prompt.format(
            evaluation_result=state['evaluation_result']
        )
        message = HumanMessage(content=formatted_prompt)
        response = chat_model.invoke([message])
        # Expecting JSON output for easier parsing
        review_result_json = response.content  # Assuming JSON here. Adapt if needed.
        state['review_result'] = review_result_json
        state['review_count'] += 1
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during review: {e}")
        state['review_result'] = {"error": str(e)} # Handle errors gracefully

    return state
```

By incorporating these changes, the notebook would be more robust and less prone to errors caused by the LLM's inherent variability. Remember to adapt the code to handle the expected JSON structure of the LLM's response.  The image generation part seems to work fine, as long as the graph compilation succeeds. The issue is solely with the LLM's output and error handling within the workflow.


## RUBRIC MODULE 3: Evaluation

This evaluation assesses Module 3 based on the provided rubric and Jupyter Notebook code.  The code attempts to automate Java code evaluation using Langchain and a large language model (LLM). Let's break down the assessment based on the rubric criteria:


**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompts are well-structured and attempt to guide the LLM effectively.  They clearly specify the expected input (student code, model solution, full rubric), output format, and constraints. However, there's room for improvement:

    * **Ambiguity in class extraction:** The prompt for class extraction doesn't explicitly handle edge cases like comments within class definitions or complex nested class structures.  The LLM might struggle with poorly formatted code. This makes the prompt slightly incomplete.  Therefore, I'll give **2 marks** here.
    * **Rubric Specificity:** While the rubric extraction prompt is detailed, it could benefit from examples of how to extract relevant rubric sections for different types of code elements.   This adds to the incompleteness.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code successfully extracts the LLM's response and stores it in the state variable.  However, the success of the *actual* class extraction depends entirely on the LLM's capabilities and the quality of the input code. The code doesn't include error handling for cases where the LLM fails to correctly parse the classes.  This is a critical omission. Therefore, I'll give **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves the extracted class information to state variables (`extracted_classes`, `extracted_rubric`, etc.).  **1 mark** is awarded here.


**Overall Score for Extract Class Method:** 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 / 6**


**Additional Observations and Potential Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling. If the LLM returns unexpected output or fails to extract classes, the program might crash or produce incorrect results.  Adding `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors is crucial.
* **LLM Choice:** The use of `gpt-4o-mini` might limit the accuracy of class extraction, especially for complex Java code.  Experimenting with more powerful models (like `gpt-4`) could improve performance.
* **Code Formatting and Parsing:**  The code relies heavily on the LLM's ability to parse the Java code correctly. A pre-processing step to format the code consistently (e.g., using a dedicated Java formatter) could improve reliability.  Consider using a dedicated parser for extracting class information rather than relying solely on the LLM.
* **Review Loop:** The review loop is a good concept, but the stopping condition (`state['review_count'] >= 2`) is arbitrary. A more sophisticated approach might involve setting a threshold based on the consistency of the evaluation or using a different termination criteria.
* **Rubric Structure:** The provided rubric is quite comprehensive, but its structure could be simplified for easier parsing by the LLM.  A structured format (like JSON) might be more suitable.

**Conclusion:**

The module demonstrates a promising approach to automating Java code evaluation.  However, it needs significant improvements in error handling, robustness, and potentially the use of more sophisticated parsing techniques to reliably extract classes and ensure accurate evaluation.  The current implementation is functional but requires more work to become robust and reliable.  The reliance on a single LLM for several distinct tasks (extraction, evaluation, review) introduces a significant single point of failure.  Breaking down these tasks further could also increase robustness.


The code you provided implements a Langchain workflow for evaluating student code. Let's analyze Module 4's rubric criteria for the `extract_rubric` method:


**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The `rubric_extraction_template` prompt is quite well-designed. It clearly instructs the LLM to:

    * Focus solely on the student's code.
    * Extract only relevant rubric sections.
    * Specify the desired output format (Class Name, Relevant Rubric Details).
    * Emphasize not providing evaluation or scoring.

    It includes all necessary details (`extraction_content`, `full_rubric`).  Therefore, I would award **3 marks** for Prompt Design.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `extract_rubric` function correctly extracts the LLM's response and saves it to `state['extracted_rubric']`. However, the success of the *extraction* depends entirely on the LLM's ability to correctly parse and extract the rubric details based on the prompt.  The provided notebook doesn't show the LLM's actual output.  Without that output, I can only assume it works correctly, giving a tentative **2 marks**.  This needs to be verified by testing with real student code and rubric data.


* **State Saving (1 mark):**  The `extract_rubric` function saves the extracted rubric details in the `state` dictionary under the key `'extracted_rubric'`. This is done correctly.  Therefore, **1 mark** is awarded.


**Total Score for `extract_rubric` method:** 3 + 2 + 1 = **6 marks** (tentative, pending verification of LLM's output).


**Improvements and Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling.  If the LLM fails to provide the expected output format, the program might crash or produce incorrect results.  Adding `try-except` blocks would improve robustness.

* **LLM Output Validation:**  The code should include validation to check if the LLM's response conforms to the expected format. This validation could involve regular expressions or other parsing techniques to ensure that the extracted rubric details are correctly structured.

* **More Robust Parsing:** The current parsing relies heavily on the LLM consistently providing data in the specified format. More sophisticated parsing techniques (e.g., using a dedicated JSON parser if the LLM outputs JSON) could handle variations in the LLM's response.


In summary, the `extract_rubric` method *appears* to meet the rubric requirements based on the code alone. However, thorough testing with different inputs is crucial to confirm its functionality and robustness.  The tentative 6/6 score needs validation through such testing.


Based on the provided code and output, here's an evaluation of Module 5 using the given rubric:


**3. Initial Evaluation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design is well-structured. It includes the student code, model solution, and the full rubric.  All necessary information is provided for accurate assessment.  **Score: 3/3**

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code successfully extracts the numeric scores (8 out of 10) and detailed evaluation comments from the LLM's response. However, there is a `KeyError` for `review_result`, indicating an issue with extracting this specific part of the response.  **Score: 1/2** (Partial success due to the `KeyError`)

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code attempts state management using the `State` dictionary to pass information between nodes.  However, the `KeyError` suggests a problem in consistently saving and retrieving all parts of the state. **Score: 0/1** (Failure due to the `KeyError`)


**Total Score for Module 5: 4/6**

**Reasons for Deductions:**

The main issue lies in the handling of the LLM's response and state management. The `KeyError: 'review_result'` indicates that the `review_evaluation` function isn't correctly setting or the `run_evaluation` function isn't correctly retrieving the `review_result` from the `State` dictionary. This needs to be debugged.  The likely cause is inconsistent key names or a failure to handle potential variations in the LLM's output format.


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling within the `run_evaluation` and individual node functions to catch and handle exceptions like `KeyError`.  Include logging to help diagnose the problem.

2. **Input Validation:** The `extract_marks` function relies on a regular expression to parse the score.  It should be made more robust to handle potential variations in the LLM's output format. Consider adding more specific checks and error handling.

3. **Output Consistency:** Ensure the LLM's response consistently provides the expected keys ('evaluation_result', 'review_result', etc.). This may require prompt engineering adjustments or more sophisticated parsing techniques.

4. **Debugging:** Carefully trace the execution flow, particularly focusing on how the `State` dictionary is updated and accessed in each node. Print statements at various points can help pinpoint the source of the `KeyError`.

5. **Testing:**  Add more thorough unit tests to validate that all parts of the state are being saved and retrieved correctly.  Test with various LLM responses to make sure the code is resilient.


By addressing these points, the module can achieve a much higher score, demonstrating a more reliable and complete evaluation system.


Based on the provided code and its output, let's evaluate Module 6 according to the rubric:

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt for reviewing the evaluation (the `review_template`) is well-structured.  It clearly states the task (reviewing an evaluation), provides the evaluation to be reviewed, outlines specific criteria for the review (completeness, fairness, clarity, accuracy), and specifies the desired output format.  Therefore, it earns **3 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to extract the reviewed evaluation and adjustments. However, the output shows a `KeyError: 'review_result'`. This indicates a failure to correctly extract the `review_result` from the LLM's response.  This is a critical error.  Therefore, it earns **0 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code attempts to save the reviewed evaluation (`state['review_result'] = response.content`). However, due to the extraction failure, no state is correctly saved.  Therefore, it earns **0 marks**.


**Overall Module 6 Score:** 3 / 6

The primary reason for the low score is the failure of the `review_evaluation` function to correctly extract the LLM's response.  The prompt design is excellent, but the implementation of parsing and state saving is faulty.  The `KeyError` suggests that the LLM response is not formatted as expected by the code. Debugging is necessary to identify why the "review_result" key is missing from the dictionary returned by the LLM.  This likely requires inspecting the actual JSON response from the LLM to understand its structure and adjust the code accordingly.  The regular expression used to extract scores in `extract_marks` seems robust enough but is irrelevant given that the larger extraction issue exists.


The provided notebook attempts to automate the evaluation of student code against a rubric using Langchain and a large language model (LLM). Let's analyze the `Marks Extraction Method` based on the provided rubric.

**1. Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The prompt for rubric extraction (`rubric_extraction_template`) is well-structured and comprehensive.  It clearly instructs the LLM on the task, provides necessary context (extracted classes and the full rubric), and specifies the desired output format. This earns **3 marks**.

The prompt for evaluation (`evaluation_template`) is similarly good, clearly outlining the task, providing the needed inputs, and detailing the expected output format.  This contributes to the overall success of the prompt design.

**2. Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The `extract_marks` function uses regular expressions (`re.findall`) to parse the LLM's evaluation output.  This is a reasonable approach, but its effectiveness depends entirely on the consistency of the LLM's response format.  If the LLM deviates from the expected "Score: X out of Y" pattern, the regular expression will fail.   The notebook shows it successfully extracts in this example.  However, robustness is an issue. Therefore, it gets **1 mark**.  A more robust solution would involve more sophisticated parsing or error handling.


**3. State Saving (1 mark):**

The `marks_extraction` function correctly saves the extracted marks into the `state['final_score']` dictionary.  This is a crucial step, and it functions correctly in this instance.  Therefore, it receives **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Marks Extraction Method:**

3 (Prompt Design) + 1 (Parsing/Output Extraction) + 1 (State Saving) = **5 marks out of 6**

**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Robustness of Parsing:** The regular expression-based parsing is fragile.  The LLM's output needs to be perfectly formatted for it to work. Consider using a more flexible parsing approach, such as natural language processing techniques, or implementing error handling to gracefully manage variations in the LLM's output.

* **Error Handling:**  The code lacks error handling. If the LLM returns an unexpected response or fails to extract relevant information, the script might crash or produce incorrect results. Adding `try-except` blocks to catch potential errors would improve reliability.

* **Testing:**  The notebook demonstrates the process with one example. More comprehensive testing with a variety of student code and LLM responses is necessary to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the marks extraction method under different conditions.


The code, while functional in the example, needs additional robustness and error handling to be truly reliable in a production-level automated grading system.  The current implementation is prone to failure if the LLM response is not exactly as expected.


The provided notebook attempts to automate a code evaluation process using Langchain and a large language model (LLM). Let's analyze the `marks_extraction` function and its interaction with the overall rubric scoring, then assess its adherence to the rubric's criteria for Module 8.

**`marks_extraction` Function and Rubric Scoring:**

The `extract_marks` function within `marks_extraction` uses regular expressions to extract scores from the LLM's evaluation output.  It sums the individual scores for each criterion. This is a reasonable approach, *assuming* the LLM consistently formats the output as specified in the `evaluation_template`.  However, the robustness of this function hinges entirely on the LLM's reliability in producing the expected output format.  If the LLM's response varies, the regular expression will fail, leading to incorrect mark extraction.

**Adherence to Module 8 Rubric:**

Let's evaluate the notebook against the Module 8 rubric:

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design for extracting marks (`extract_marks` and its use within `marks_extraction`) is indirectly related to the `sum_marks` tool.  The rubric states that the prompt should *strictly* use the `sum_marks` tool, which isn't explicitly present. The notebook instead uses regular expressions to parse the LLM's output to find and sum scores. This is not strictly adhering to the rubric's requirement.  Therefore, a score of **1 or 2 marks** is appropriate.  It partially meets the requirement by extracting and summing scores, but doesn't use a dedicated `sum_marks` tool.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The parsing relies on the regular expression in `extract_marks`. As noted above, this is fragile. The LLM could return unexpected output, causing the regex to fail and return an incorrect sum or no sum at all. Because of this fragility, the score is **1 mark**. It *partially* extracts the correct sum but lacks robustness.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The notebook correctly saves the final total in the `state['final_score']`. This aspect works as intended. Therefore, it receives **1 mark**.

**Overall Module 8 Score:**

Based on the above analysis, a plausible Module 8 score for this notebook would be **3 or 4 out of 6**. The significant flaw is the lack of a dedicated `sum_marks` tool and the fragility of the regex-based parsing.  A more robust solution would involve a function specifically designed for summing the scores from a structured data format (e.g., a JSON object instead of free-form text) returned by the LLM.  This would improve the reliability and make the solution more directly address the requirements of the rubric.


Based on the provided code and rubric, here's an evaluation of the "Graph Construction" module (Module 9):


**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The code correctly adds five nodes to the `workflow` graph: "extract_classes", "extract_rubric", "evaluate_classes", "review_evaluation", and "marks_extraction".  These correspond to the five functions defined.  Therefore, this section receives **5 marks**.

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code adds the following edges:
    * "extract_classes" -> "extract_rubric"
    * "extract_rubric" -> "evaluate_classes"
    * "evaluate_classes" -> "review_evaluation"
    * "review_evaluation" -> "marks_extraction" (conditional)
    * "marks_extraction" -> END

The conditional edge from "review_evaluation" to "evaluate_classes" or "marks_extraction" based on the `is_evaluation_good` function's output is also correctly implemented using `add_conditional_edges`. Therefore, this section also receives **5 marks**.

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The code compiles the graph using `app = workflow.compile()`. This line executes without error, indicating successful compilation. Therefore, this section receives **4 marks**.


**Total Marks for Graph Construction: 5 + 5 + 4 = 14 marks**

The code demonstrates a proper LangGraph workflow with correctly added nodes and edges, and successful compilation.  The use of conditional edges adds complexity and shows understanding of the LangGraph capabilities.


This Jupyter Notebook uses Langchain to automate the evaluation of student code against a rubric. Let's break down the code and address the error.

**Code Breakdown:**

The notebook defines a workflow using Langchain's `StateGraph`.  This workflow consists of several nodes:

1. **`extract_classes`:** Extracts class definitions from student and model solutions using a prompt.
2. **`extract_rubric`:** Extracts relevant rubric sections for each student class.
3. **`evaluate_classes`:** Evaluates student code based on the extracted rubric, providing scores and reasoning.
4. **`review_evaluation`:** Reviews the automated evaluation for completeness, fairness, clarity, and accuracy.  This node is crucial for quality control.
5. **`marks_extraction`:** Extracts the final numerical score from the evaluation.

The workflow uses conditional logic (`is_evaluation_good`) to determine if the evaluation needs further review. If the review is "good," or the maximum number of reviews is reached, it proceeds to `marks_extraction`. Otherwise, it loops back to `evaluate_classes` for another evaluation.

**Error Analysis:**

The `KeyError: 'review_result'` arises because the `review_result` key is missing from the `result` dictionary after the workflow execution.  This indicates that the `review_evaluation` node likely failed to execute correctly.

**Reasons for Failure and Potential Solutions:**

1. **Prompt Engineering:** The prompts, especially `review_template`, might be too complex or ambiguous for the LLM.  The LLM might not understand the instructions clearly, leading to an incomplete or missing response.  Try simplifying the prompts, providing clearer instructions, and adding specific examples of the desired output format.

2. **LLM Limitations:** Even with well-crafted prompts, LLMs can occasionally fail to generate the expected output.  This is inherent to their probabilistic nature.  Retrying the evaluation or using a different LLM (if possible) could help.

3. **Context Window:** The LLM might be exceeding its context window. If the combined length of the student code, model solution, extracted classes, and full rubric exceeds the LLM's token limit, parts of the information might be lost, leading to errors. You might need to break down the input into smaller chunks or use a technique like summarization to reduce the total input size.

4. **Asynchronous Operations:** If the `chat_model.invoke` calls are asynchronous, ensure they're properly awaited before accessing the results.  Improper handling of asynchronous tasks can lead to accessing data before it's ready.

5. **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling within the functions.  For example, include `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions during prompt formatting, LLM invocation, or result parsing.


**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Print Statements:** Add `print(formatted_prompt)` inside each function before the `chat_model.invoke` call to inspect the prompts sent to the LLM.  Also, add `print(response.content)` to see the LLM's raw response. This will help pinpoint where the problem occurs.

2. **Simplify:** Start by simplifying the workflow.  Test each node individually with smaller, simpler inputs to isolate the problematic node.

3. **Check Token Limits:** Determine the token limits of your LLM and calculate the token usage of your inputs to make sure you are within the limit.

4. **Inspect the LLM Response:** The raw response from `chat_model.invoke` might contain clues about why the `review_result` key is missing. Look for error messages or incomplete output.

5. **Review the `is_evaluation_good` Function:**  Ensure this function is correctly identifying the "Overall Assessment" and handling edge cases properly.

**Revised Code (with Debugging):**

This revised code incorporates additional print statements for debugging and error handling:

```python
# ... (Previous code remains the same) ...

def review_evaluation(state: State) -> State:
    try:
        formatted_prompt = review_prompt.format(evaluation_result=state['evaluation_result'])
        print("Review Prompt:\n", formatted_prompt)  # Added print statement
        message = HumanMessage(content=formatted_prompt)
        response = chat_model.invoke([message])
        print("Review Response:\n", response.content)  # Added print statement
        state['review_result'] = response.content
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error in review_evaluation: {e}")  # Error handling
        state['review_result'] = "Error during review"
    state['review_count'] += 1
    return state

# ... (Rest of the code remains the same) ...
```

Remember to run this revised code and examine the printed output to diagnose the specific reason for the error.  The error messages and LLM responses will guide you in refining your prompts or handling potential exceptions.  Focus on simplifying your prompts and adding error handling to make the code more robust.
