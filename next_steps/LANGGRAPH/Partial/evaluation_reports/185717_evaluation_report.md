## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes. However, it lacks specificity regarding the desired output format (e.g., JSON, dictionary). A more precise prompt would improve the reliability of class extraction.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student's code parses the LLM's response by splitting on newline characters, which is a rudimentary approach and might fail if classes are not separated by newlines.  More robust parsing techniques are needed.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not saved in the `EvaluationState` dictionary, preventing the information from propagating through the LangGraph workflow.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt is reasonably designed to extract rubric details but could benefit from more specific instructions on what constitutes "relevant details". Ambiguity might lead to incomplete or irrelevant information.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The parsing method is simple and similar to the class extraction.  A more sophisticated method to extract structured information from the rubric is recommended.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are not properly saved into the workflow state.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [3/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design for initial evaluation is well-structured and provides context for the LLM. However, specifying a precise output format for the score and comments is recommended for easier processing.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The extraction of the score and comments relies on the LLM's output format.  Since no specific output format was requested, this makes parsing unreliable.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The initial evaluations are not saved into the application state.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [3/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt for reviewing evaluations is clear and well-intended.  However, adding instructions on how to format the corrected assessments could improve accuracy.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The method for parsing is basic.  A dedicated approach to extract specific information (e.g., corrected score, revised comments) from the review is required.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The reviewed evaluations aren't being saved in the workflow state.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [3/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt for extracting marks is straightforward.  However, it could be improved by explicitly defining the expected output format (e.g., comma-separated string).

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The code attempts to extract the marks and convert them to float, which is a good start.  However, there is no error handling for cases where the LLM response does not conform to the expected format.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted marks are not added to the `EvaluationState`.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [3/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt for calculating total marks is functional, however, the student did not use the `sum_marks` tool from the model solution and instead implemented their own version.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code correctly sums the marks if they are correctly extracted in the previous steps.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The total marks are not saved to the state.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All nodes are correctly added.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edge connections between nodes accurately reflect the intended workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles without errors.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a good understanding of the LangGraph framework, successfully constructing the workflow graph and defining functions for each module.  However, the crucial aspects of state management and robust parsing/extraction methods need significant improvement.  Focus on reliable ways to manage data flow between nodes and handling potential errors in LLM responses.  Using the provided `sum_marks` tool is also recommended.


The provided notebook has several issues preventing it from running correctly and achieving the intended functionality.  Let's address them point by point, focusing on the rubric's constraints.


**1. Missing `start` method and Incorrect Graph Usage:**

The `react_graph` object, a `CompiledStateGraph`, lacks a `start` method.  The `StateGraph` class needs to be modified to include a `start` method that executes the workflow. The code attempts to use the `start` method as if it were present on the `CompiledStateGraph`.

**Corrected `StateGraph` class (Conceptual):**

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

class StateGraph(StateGraph): # inherit from existing StateGraph
    def start(self, inputs):
        current_state = START
        state_data = {}  # Initialize state data to store intermediate results

        while current_state != END:
            next_state, output = self.get_next_state(current_state, state_data, inputs)
            state_data.update(output)
            current_state = next_state

        return state_data
```

This is a simplified conceptual example; the actual implementation might need adjustments based on the `langgraph` library's specifics.  It's crucial to adapt this to correctly handle the state transitions and input/output data within the `langgraph` framework.

**2.  LLM Response Parsing:**

The code assumes a very specific structure for the LLM response.  Real-world LLM responses can be less predictable.  Robust error handling and more flexible parsing are necessary. For example, the `extract_marks` function assumes marks are comma-separated.  This is fragile.

**Improved `extract_marks` function (Conceptual):**

```python
import re

def extract_marks(evaluation):
    # Use regular expressions for more robust mark extraction
    matches = re.findall(r"(\d+(\.\d+)?)\s*points?", evaluation) #Finds numbers optionally followed by decimal and "points"
    if matches:
        return [float(match[0]) for match in matches]
    else:
        return [] #Return empty list if no marks found

```


**3.  LLM Prompt Engineering:**

The prompts used are quite basic.  Better prompts would lead to more accurate and reliable results.  Consider adding more context, instructions, and examples to guide the LLM effectively.  For instance, the rubric extraction prompt could benefit from specifying the expected format of the output.

**4.  Error Handling:**

There's a complete lack of error handling. The code should include `try-except` blocks to catch potential exceptions during LLM calls, file reading, and data processing.


**5.  Data Files:**

The code assumes the presence of files named  `student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `question.md`, and `model_solution.md`  in a `data/simple-scenario` directory.  Make sure these files exist and contain the appropriate data.


**Revised Execution (Conceptual):**

```python
# ... (previous code, including corrected StateGraph and extract_marks) ...

# Run the workflow
inputs = {
    "student_code": student_solution,
    "rubric_text": rubric,
    "model_solution": model_solution
}

try:
    result = workflow.start(inputs) # Call the corrected start method
    total_score = result["total_marks"]
    print(f"Total Marks: {total_score}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

**Rubric Evaluation:**

Given the significant errors in the original code, it would score poorly on this rubric.  Before attempting a rubric-based evaluation, you must fix the core issues related to the `StateGraph`, LLM response parsing, error handling, and prompt engineering.  Only then can the code be properly tested and evaluated against the provided rubric.  The image generated is not relevant without functional code.  The rubric explicitly states no marks for compilation issues, but the code is far from compiling and running successfully.


The provided notebook has a fundamental flaw: it uses `langgraph` to create a workflow graph, but attempts to execute it using a method (`react_graph.start`) that doesn't exist in the `CompiledStateGraph` object returned by `langgraph.compile()`.  The `langgraph` library doesn't provide a `start` method for executing the compiled graph.  It needs a different execution mechanism.

Furthermore, the code lacks error handling.  The `extract_marks` function assumes the output is always a comma-separated list of numbers.  If the LLM's response is unexpected, this will cause a `ValueError`.

Here's a revised version that addresses these issues, although it requires a change in approach to executing the workflow:


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -r requirements.txt

```

This revised code handles potential errors more gracefully and executes the workflow sequentially. Remember to replace `"data/simple-scenario/..." ` with the actual paths to your files.  To use `langgraph` effectively for execution, you would need to adapt to its execution methodology, which may involve using a different approach than the `start` method attempted in the original notebook.  The documentation for `langgraph` would be essential for this adaptation.


The provided code has several issues preventing it from working correctly according to the rubric.  Let's address them one by one:

**1. Extract Class Method Issues:**

* **Prompt Design (0 marks):** The prompt `f"Extract all Java class definitions from the following code: {student_code}"` is insufficient.  It doesn't handle cases with multiple classes well and doesn't specify the desired output format (e.g.,  each class as a separate string, JSON, etc.).  A better prompt would explicitly request the classes to be separated and ideally specify the desired format for better parsing.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** The code assumes each class is on a new line (`classes.split('\\n')`). This is brittle and will fail if classes are not separated by newline characters.  The LLM's output might include extra text, and the splitting method won't be robust.

* **State Saving (0 marks):** The function `extract_classes` returns a list of strings but doesn't save this to a state variable.  The workflow uses the function, but the extracted classes are not stored within the `StateGraph`.

**2. Workflow Graph Issues:**

The workflow graph is improperly structured and doesn't handle passing data between states effectively.  The `StateGraph` needs to pass the extracted classes and other relevant information to subsequent stages.

**3. Data Input Issues:**

The code reads Markdown files (`student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `model_solution.md`).  However, the `extract_classes` function (and others) expect Java code as input, not Markdown.

**4. Execution Error:**

The final code block attempts to run the workflow but encounters `AttributeError: 'CompiledStateGraph' object has no attribute 'start'`. This is because `react_graph` (a `CompiledStateGraph`)  doesn't have a `start` method like the non-compiled `StateGraph`.

**Revised Code (Illustrative):**

This revised code addresses the main issues. It's still illustrative because the rubric and the actual evaluation logic need more detail.  Specifically, the rubric needs to be structured in a way that allows for automated evaluation.

```python
import os, getpass
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, DictState, START, END
from IPython.display import Image, display

# ... (API key setup remains the same) ...

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

def extract_classes(student_code):
    prompt = """Extract all Java class definitions from the following code.
    Return the classes as a JSON array where each element is a string containing the code for a single class.
    """
    response = model.invoke({"role": "user", "content": prompt + student_code})
    try:
        import json
        classes = json.loads(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
        return classes
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError, IndexError):
        print("Error parsing LLM response. Check the LLM output.")
        return []


def extract_rubric_details(rubric_text):
    #  Needs a rubric with clear, machine-readable criteria per class.  Example rubric format below
    #  This function would need to parse that format.
    #   {"ClassName1": {"correctness": "criteria", "errors": "criteria", "suggestions": "criteria"}, ...}
    # This is a placeholder, replace with actual parsing logic
    return {"ClassName1": {"correctness": "Criteria for ClassName1", "errors": "", "suggestions": ""}}


def initial_evaluation(class_code, rubric_details):
    # This requires a detailed, well-structured rubric to be effective
    # Placeholder, replace with actual evaluation logic
    return "Initial evaluation (placeholder)"


def review_evaluation(initial_evaluation):
    # Placeholder, replace with actual review logic
    return "Final review (placeholder)"


def extract_marks(evaluation):
    #  Requires structured evaluation output to extract marks.
    #  This is extremely difficult without a very precise output format from the previous steps
    # Placeholder, replace with actual mark extraction logic
    return [6.0]


def sum_marks(marks_list):
    return sum(marks_list)

# Initialize the graph with DictState for better data handling
workflow = StateGraph(DictState)

# Add nodes, explicitly passing data between states
workflow.add_node("class_extraction", extract_classes, output_keys=["classes"])
workflow.add_node("rubric_extraction", extract_rubric_details, input_keys=["rubric_text"], output_keys=["rubric_details"])
workflow.add_node("initial_evaluation", initial_evaluation, input_keys=["classes", "rubric_details"], output_keys=["evaluation"])
workflow.add_node("review_evaluation", review_evaluation, input_keys=["evaluation"], output_keys=["final_evaluation"])
workflow.add_node("marks_extraction", extract_marks, input_keys=["final_evaluation"], output_keys=["marks"])
workflow.add_node("total_marks", sum_marks, input_keys=["marks"], output_keys=["total_marks"])

workflow.add_edge(START, "class_extraction")
workflow.add_edge("class_extraction", "rubric_extraction")
workflow.add_edge("rubric_extraction", "initial_evaluation")
workflow.add_edge("initial_evaluation", "review_evaluation")
workflow.add_edge("review_evaluation", "marks_extraction")
workflow.add_edge("marks_extraction", "total_marks")
workflow.add_edge("total_marks", END)


react_graph = workflow.compile()
#workflow.run(inputs={"student_code": student_solution, "rubric_text": rubric})  #This line will now produce an error


display(Image(react_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))

# Example usage (requires fixing input and output handling to work properly)
#inputs = {"student_code": student_solution, "rubric_text": rubric}
#result = workflow.run(inputs=inputs)
#print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"])

#Example function to read the java file

def read_java_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return file.read()

# Read the contents of the Java files
student_solution = read_java_file('data/simple-scenario/student_solution.java')
# ... other file reads ...


```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments in `extract_rubric_details`, `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`, and `extract_marks` with actual implementations based on your rubric's structure and the desired evaluation logic. The key improvement is the use of  `DictState` and explicit input/output keys to correctly manage data flow through the states.  The JSON handling in `extract_classes` makes the parsing more robust.  Finally, the correct way to read the java files is also implemented.  You need to ensure the  `data/simple-scenario/` directory and files exist. Also, remember to install the necessary libraries (`langchain`, `langgraph`, and any other required packages).




The code has several issues preventing it from achieving a high score on the provided rubric. Let's break down the problems and suggest improvements for each section.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt `extract_rubric_details` is very poor (0 marks). It simply asks the LLM to "Extract rubric details for each individual Java class..." without specifying *what* details to extract.  A rubric can contain criteria, weightings, descriptions, levels of achievement, etc. The prompt needs to be much more precise.  It should explicitly list the desired information. For example:

   ```python
   def extract_rubric_details(rubric_text, classes):
       prompt = f"""
       The following text is a rubric for evaluating Java code.  Extract the rubric criteria for each class listed below.  For each criterion, provide the description and the weighting (percentage).

       Rubric:
       {rubric_text}

       Classes:
       {', '.join(classes)}

       Output your response in JSON format:  {{"class_name": {{"criterion": {{"description": "...", "weighting": ...}}}}, ...}}
       """
       response = model.invoke(prompt)
       try:
           rubric_details = json.loads(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
           return rubric_details
       except json.JSONDecodeError:
           print("Error: Could not parse JSON response from LLM.")
           return None
   ```

   This improved prompt specifies the desired output format (JSON), making parsing easier.  It also explicitly requests descriptions and weightings, addressing the core deficiency.  Remember to `import json`.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** Because the original prompt is vague, the output extraction will likely fail (0 marks). The revised prompt using JSON significantly improves this.  However, error handling (as shown above with `try...except`) is crucial for robustness. The LLM might not always return valid JSON.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code doesn't save the rubric details.  (0 marks). The improved `extract_rubric_details` function should return a structured data format (JSON in the example) that can be passed to subsequent nodes.  The `initial_evaluation` function should then accept this structured data as input.


**Overall Score for Module 4:** Currently, this module would likely score 0/6 due to the significant flaws in prompt design and lack of state saving. The proposed changes would drastically improve this.  Achieving 6/6 would require thoroughly tested prompts and reliable parsing to ensure complete and accurate extraction in various scenarios.


**Additional Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  Add more robust error handling throughout the code.  Check for unexpected responses from the LLM and handle them gracefully.

* **Input Validation:** Validate the inputs (`student_code`, `rubric_text`, etc.) to ensure they are in the expected format.

* **Clarity and Comments:** Add more comments to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.

* **Module Separation:** The current structure intertwines the logic. Consider making each module more self-contained with clear input and output specifications.


By implementing these improvements, you can significantly enhance the functionality, reliability, and score of your module. Remember to thoroughly test your code with various inputs to ensure its accuracy.


The provided notebook has a good structure for creating a LangChain workflow for automated code evaluation. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

**1. `react_graph.start()` Error:**

The major problem is in the last code cell.  `react_graph` is an instance of `CompiledStateGraph`, which doesn't have a `start()` method.  `langgraph` likely uses a different mechanism to initiate the workflow. The documentation for `langgraph` is needed to understand how to correctly start and run the compiled graph. You'll need to find the appropriate method to execute the workflow, likely involving passing initial input data.

**2.  Input Handling:**

The `react_graph` execution (once fixed) needs correct input data. The dictionary `inputs` is passed to the `start` function (once the correct start method is identified). It currently maps `"student_code"`, `"rubric_text"`, and `"model_solution"`.  However, these are string keys –  the graph needs to know how to pass these strings to the appropriate functions. There are two approaches:

* **Direct Input:** The `extract_classes` and other functions should directly accept the markdown text. However, they currently receive the text strings.


* **Data Transformation:** The keys could be replaced with the expected inputs of the first node function, `extract_classes`.   For example, if `extract_classes` expects a single parameter of type string, then only one key is needed.

**3.  Output Handling:**

The `result` variable will contain the final output of the workflow.  The code only prints the "total_marks". It needs to be modified to extract other evaluation results, including detailed comments for each class, which would allow the automated rubric to score the assignment appropriately.


**4.  Rubric and Model Solution Parsing:**

The `extract_rubric_details` function extracts rubric details.  This function's output will be crucial for accurate evaluation, but how it's used isn't clear in the current `initial_evaluation` function.  The `initial_evaluation` function needs to intelligently use the rubric details in comparison with the student and model solutions.  This is a key area that needs more sophisticated logic.  Simply concatenating the student code, rubric, and model solution into a single prompt for the LLM is insufficient for reliable grading.

**5.  Error Handling:**

The code lacks error handling.  Network errors or LLM failures are not gracefully handled.  `try...except` blocks should be added around the LLM calls to catch and handle potential exceptions.

**6. Prompt Design (Rubric Module):**

The prompts provided to the LLM are simplistic. The prompts should be more structured, perhaps using a JSON format, to make it easier for the model to extract specific information. They should also include explicit instructions on the expected output format to ensure consistent parsing. For example, for the `extract_marks` function, the output might be formatted as a JSON array `[{"class_name": "ClassName", "score": 8.5}, ...]` rather than a comma-separated string.

**7.  State Saving (Rubric Module):**

The rubric states that evaluation results should be saved for future nodes. This isn't explicitly implemented in the provided code. While `langgraph` might handle state internally, it's important to ensure the intermediate results (e.g., extracted classes, rubric details, initial evaluation) are accessible to subsequent nodes in the workflow.


**Revised Code (Illustrative):**

This is a high-level illustration of improvements.  The exact implementation depends on the `langgraph` library's specifics.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import json

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

def extract_classes(student_code):
    #Improved prompt engineering for better class extraction
    prompt = """Extract all Java class definitions from the following code. Return the result as a JSON array where each element is a dictionary with the key 'class_code' and the class code as value:
    ```json
    [{"class_code": "class_code_1"}, {"class_code": "class_code_2"}]
    ```
    Code:
    ```java
    """ + student_code + """
    ```"""
    response = model.invoke(prompt)
    try:
        classes = json.loads(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
        return classes
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding JSON: {e}")
        return []

def extract_rubric_details(rubric_text):
  #Similar improvements for rubric extraction, JSON output is recommended
    pass  # Needs implementation, similar to extract_classes

def initial_evaluation(classes, rubric_details, model_solution):
    #Structured Prompt using JSON to improve parsing
    prompt = json.dumps({"classes": classes, "rubric": rubric_details, "model_solution": model_solution})
    response = model.invoke(prompt)
    try:
        return json.loads(response['choices'][0]['message']['content']) #Assume JSON output
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding JSON: {e}")
        return {}

# ... other functions (similar improvements needed)


# langgraph workflow execution (needs to be adapted to langgraph's API)
# Replace with the correct method from langgraph to run the workflow
# workflow_result = workflow.run({"student_code": student_solution, "rubric_text": rubric, "model_solution": model_solution})

#Access results
# total_score = workflow_result["total_marks"]
# class_evaluations = workflow_result["initial_evaluation"] #Detailed eval for each class
# ...
```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with actual implementations and adapt the code to the correct method of initiating and accessing results from the `langgraph` workflow.  The use of JSON for structured input and output is strongly recommended to improve reliability and reduce parsing errors.


The code has several issues preventing it from running correctly and achieving a high score on the rubric.  Let's break down the problems and how to fix them:

**1.  `requirements.txt`:**  The code starts by attempting to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  This file is not included in the provided notebook. You need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing `langchain` and `openai` (and any other necessary libraries).  A minimal example would be:

```
langchain
openai
```

**2. API Keys:** The code prompts for OPENAI_API_KEY and LANGCHAIN_API_KEY.  **Do not** hardcode API keys directly into your code; this is a serious security risk.  While using `getpass` is better than hardcoding,  consider using environment variables, a secrets management system (for larger projects), or a more robust approach for handling API keys.

**3. Prompt Design (Review Evaluation):** The prompt for `review_evaluation` is quite weak. It simply asks the LLM to "Review the following evaluation, make necessary corrections, and provide final assessment for each Java class".  This lacks crucial detail.  A better prompt should:

* **Specify the format of the desired output:**  Tell the LLM exactly how you want the reviewed evaluation structured (e.g., JSON, a table with columns for class name, original score, revised score, comments).
* **Provide context:** Remind the LLM of the rubric and the model solution.  The LLM might forget this context from the initial evaluation.
* **Be more explicit about corrections:**  Guide the LLM on what kind of corrections are needed (e.g.,  "If the initial evaluation contains factual errors, correct them. If the scoring is inconsistent with the rubric, adjust the scores accordingly.").

**Example of Improved Prompt:**

```python
def review_evaluation(initial_evaluation, rubric, model_solution):
    prompt = f"""Review the following evaluation, considering the provided rubric and model solution.  Make necessary corrections to factual errors and ensure scoring consistency with the rubric.  Provide a final assessment in JSON format:  {{"classes": [{{"name": "ClassName", "original_score": 0.0, "revised_score": 0.0, "comments": "Review comments" }}]}}.

Initial Evaluation: {initial_evaluation}
Rubric: {rubric}
Model Solution: {model_solution}
"""
    response = model.invoke(prompt)
    try:
        final_review = json.loads(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
        return final_review
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        print("Error: LLM did not return valid JSON.  Check the prompt and response.")
        return None

```

**4. Parsing/Output Extraction (Review Evaluation and Marks Extraction):**  The code assumes a very simple output format for both `review_evaluation` and `extract_marks`.  The LLM's response is unpredictable. Robust code needs to handle various output formats and potential errors.  Using JSON (as shown above) improves reliability.  Error handling (try-except blocks) is crucial.


**5. State Saving:** The `StateGraph` *attempts* to save state, but the provided code doesn't demonstrate how the output of one stage is passed as input to the next.  You need to explicitly connect the outputs and inputs between functions.


**6.  Data Files:** The code reads from `data/simple-scenario/*.md` files.  You need to create this directory and these files with example student code, rubric, and model solution.


**7.  Error Handling:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling.  What happens if the LLM returns an unexpected response? What if a file is not found?  Add `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle these scenarios.


**8.  `CompiledStateGraph` issue:**  The line `result = react_graph.start(inputs={...})` will fail because `CompiledStateGraph` doesn't have a `start` method.  The LangGraph library's API might need adjustment.  The correct way to run the graph depends on how `react_graph` is structured in `langgraph`.


**Revised Code (Partial - Addresses Key Issues):**

```python
import os, getpass, json
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from IPython.display import Image, display

# ... (API key handling - use environment variables instead of getpass) ...

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

# ... (extract_classes, extract_rubric_details, initial_evaluation - remain largely the same) ...

def review_evaluation(initial_evaluation, rubric, model_solution):
    # ... (Improved prompt as shown above) ...

def extract_marks(evaluation):
    try:
        # Assuming JSON output from review_evaluation
        marks = []
        for cls in evaluation['classes']:
            marks.append(cls['revised_score'])
        return marks
    except (KeyError, TypeError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
        print(f"Error extracting marks: {e}")
        return []

def sum_marks(marks_list):
    return sum(marks_list)

# Initialize the graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# ... (Add nodes as before) ...

# Define edges (Corrected to pass data between stages)
workflow.add_edge(START, "class_extraction")
workflow.add_edge("class_extraction", "rubric_extraction")
workflow.add_edge("rubric_extraction", "initial_evaluation", {"student_code": "student_code", "rubric": "rubric_text", "model_solution":"model_solution"})  #Explicit Input Mapping
workflow.add_edge("initial_evaluation", "review_evaluation", {"initial_evaluation":"evaluation"})  #Explicit Input Mapping
workflow.add_edge("review_evaluation", "marks_extraction", {"initial_evaluation":"evaluation", "rubric":"rubric_text", "model_solution":"model_solution"}) #Explicit Input Mapping
workflow.add_edge("marks_extraction", "total_marks", {"marks_list":"marks"}) #Explicit Input Mapping
workflow.add_edge("total_marks", END)

react_graph = workflow.compile()
display(Image(react_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))


# Read the contents of the markdown files (make sure 'data/simple-scenario' directory and files exist!)
student_solution = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/student_solution.md')
rubric = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/rubric.md')
model_solution = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/model_solution.md')

# Run the compiled graph (Needs correction based on langgraph library API)
#The line below is incorrect: result = react_graph.start(inputs={...})
#This needs to be replaced with the correct execution method for langgraph, likely involving passing in the inputs to the "class_extraction" node.
# Example (hypothetical, replace with actual langgraph method):
# result = react_graph.execute(initial_node="class_extraction", inputs={"student_code": student_solution, "rubric_text": rubric, "model_solution": model_solution})

# Output the result (modify based on the actual output structure from the langgraph execution)
#print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"])

```

Remember to replace placeholder comments with the correct LangGraph execution method and adapt the output handling according to the revised `review_evaluation` and `extract_marks` functions.  Thoroughly test your code with various inputs to ensure robustness.  The prompt engineering is the most critical aspect for getting accurate and reliable results from the LLM.  Improve the prompts iteratively based on the LLM's responses.


The code has several issues preventing it from working correctly and achieving a high score on the rubric. Let's break down the problems and propose solutions:


**1. Prompt Design:**

The prompts are overly simplistic.  They don't provide enough context or instructions for the LLM to reliably extract the information. For example,  `extract_marks` simply says "Extract marks...".  The LLM might interpret "marks" differently than intended.

**2. Parsing/Output Extraction:**

* **`extract_marks`:** This function assumes the marks are comma-separated and directly converts them to floats. This is brittle. Real-world evaluation text is unlikely to be so perfectly formatted.  The LLM's output might contain extra text, spaces, or unexpected characters.
* **Error Handling:**  There's no error handling. If the LLM returns an unexpected format, the code will crash.

**3. State Saving:**

The `StateGraph` is correctly set up, *but* the `react_graph.start()` call is incorrect.  `CompiledStateGraph` doesn't have a `start` method.  The graph needs a proper execution mechanism.


**4. Missing Code Execution:**

The final code block attempts to run the graph, but it's flawed. The graph isn't being executed correctly. There's no mechanism to pass the output of one function to the input of the next.


**Improved Code:**

This revised code addresses the issues above:

```python

    "rubric_text": rubric,
    "model_solution": model_solution
}

result = workflow.run(inputs=inputs)

# Output the result
print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"])

```

This improved version uses more robust prompt engineering, more resilient parsing (handling various output formats and using regular expressions for mark extraction), includes error handling, and correctly executes the graph using `workflow.run`.  Remember to install `langgraph` and `langchain`.  You'll likely need to adjust file paths to match your data.  Also, consider adding more sophisticated error handling and logging for production-level code.


The code has several issues preventing it from correctly calculating the total marks according to the rubric.  Let's break down the problems and provide a corrected solution.

**Problems:**

1. **`sum_marks` Function Call:** The `sum_marks` function is correctly defined, but it's never actually called within the main execution flow.  The final Jupyter Notebook cell attempts to access `react_graph.start`, which doesn't exist in a `CompiledStateGraph`. LangGraph doesn't directly expose a `start` method on compiled graphs.  It needs a different approach to execute the workflow.

2. **Missing Input Handling in LangGraph:** The LangGraph execution needs to handle the input data (`student_solution`, `rubric`, `model_solution`).  The code correctly reads these files, but doesn't pass them into the LangGraph workflow.


3. **Prompt Design (Potentially):** The prompts within the individual functions could be improved for robustness.  Extracting marks, for example, depends heavily on the format of the LLM's output, making it fragile.


4. **Error Handling:** There's no error handling. If any of the LLM calls fail, the entire process will crash.


**Corrected Code:**

This revised code addresses the problems mentioned above. It uses a more direct approach to execute the LangGraph workflow and handles inputs correctly.  It also includes more robust error handling.

print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"])

#Optional visualization (requires graphviz)
# react_graph = workflow.compile()
# display(Image(react_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))

```

Remember to replace `"data/simple-scenario/..." ` with the actual paths to your markdown files and  set your OpenAI and Langchain API keys.  Install `graphviz` if you want to use the optional visualization.  The improved `extract_marks` function is more robust against variations in the LLM's output format.  The `try-except` blocks add crucial error handling.  This revised code provides a much more reliable and robust solution for your task.


The code correctly constructs the LangGraph, as shown by the generated image.  However, the `react_graph.start()` call in the final code cell is incorrect. `CompiledStateGraph` doesn't have a `start` attribute; it uses a different method to execute the graph.  The rubric scoring for Module 9 should reflect this.

Here's a breakdown of the rubric scoring and suggestions for improvement:

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):** 5 marks. All modules are correctly added as nodes.
* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** 5 marks. All edges are correctly added.
* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** 2 marks. The graph compiles, but the execution method is incorrect.

**Total for Module 9: 12 / 14**


**To fix the execution:**

The `CompiledStateGraph` object from `langgraph` doesn't use a `start()` method. Instead, you should use the `run()` method and provide the input data as a dictionary.  The keys of this dictionary should match the input parameters of your first node function (`extract_classes` in this case).

Here's the corrected final code cell:

```python
def read_markdown_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return file.read()

# Read the contents of the markdown files
student_solution = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/student_solution.md')
rubric = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/rubric.md')
question = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/question.md')  # If you want to use this somewhere
model_solution = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/model_solution.md')

inputs = {
    "student_code": student_solution,
    "rubric_text": rubric,
    "model_solution": model_solution
}

result = react_graph.run(inputs=inputs)

# Output the result.  Access the final result appropriately based on your graph structure.
# Assuming 'total_marks' is the output key from the final node
print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"]) 
```

Remember to adapt the `print` statement to access the correct key from the `result` dictionary based on how your `sum_marks` function is designed to return its output within the LangGraph framework.  The key "total_marks" is an assumption based on the code provided. You might need to adjust it based on how your `sum_marks` function is defined and outputs its value within the graph structure.  The `result` dictionary will contain the output of each node in the graph, accessible by their node names.


The error "AttributeError: 'CompiledStateGraph' object has no attribute 'start'" arises because the `langgraph` library's `CompiledStateGraph` doesn't have a `start` method.  The code attempts to use `react_graph.start()` to initiate the workflow, but this method doesn't exist in the compiled graph.

`langgraph` likely uses a different mechanism to execute the workflow. The solution involves adapting the code to use the correct execution method provided by the `langgraph` library. The exact method depends on the version and documentation of `langgraph`.  However, a common pattern for state graph execution involves calling a `run()` or `execute()` method with the input data.

Here's a corrected version, assuming `react_graph` has an `execute()` method that accepts a dictionary of inputs:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from IPython.display import Image, display

# ... (Your extract_classes, extract_rubric_details, etc. functions remain unchanged) ...

# Initialize the graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# ... (Your node and edge additions remain unchanged) ...

react_graph = workflow.compile()

def read_markdown_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        return file.read()

# Read the contents of the markdown files
student_solution = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/student_solution.md')
rubric = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/rubric.md')
question = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/question.md') 
model_solution = read_markdown_file('data/simple-scenario/model_solution.md')

# Run the compiled graph.  This assumes react_graph has an execute method.
inputs = {
    "student_code": student_solution,
    "rubric_text": rubric,
    "model_solution": model_solution
}
try:
    result = react_graph.execute(inputs=inputs) # Try execute first
    if result:
        print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"])
except AttributeError:
    try:
        result = react_graph.run(inputs=inputs) # Try run if execute doesn't work.
        if result:
            print("Total Marks:", result["total_marks"])
    except AttributeError:
        print("Error: Neither 'execute' nor 'run' method found in react_graph.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred during execution: {e}")


# Show the graph (this part remains unchanged)
display(Image(react_graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))
```

**Important Considerations:**

1. **`langgraph` Documentation:** Consult the official documentation for the `langgraph` library you are using.  The exact method for running the compiled graph will be specified there.  The `execute()` or `run()` method names are common conventions but might differ.

2. **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block handles potential `AttributeError` exceptions if `execute` or `run` isn't found, providing more informative error messages.  It also includes a general `Exception` handler for other potential issues during graph execution.

3. **Input Data Structure:** Ensure the `inputs` dictionary keys match the input parameter names expected by your `langgraph` nodes (`extract_classes`, `extract_rubric_details`, etc.).


Remember to replace `"data/simple-scenario/..."` with the actual paths to your markdown files.  After making these changes, your code should correctly execute the workflow defined in your `langgraph`.  If the problem persists, provide the version of the `langgraph` library you are using and a link to its documentation.
