## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes but lacks specificity. It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to return a structured format (like a JSON array of dictionaries), making parsing more complex.  The prompt also relies on the input file being a markdown file which was not specified in the problem statement.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code successfully extracts some class information, but the parsing is manual and heavily relies on the format of the LLM's output. A more robust parsing approach, such as using a regular expression or JSON parsing, would be more reliable.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted class information is saved in a dictionary within the `extracted_classes` variable.  This fulfills the state saving requirement.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
Similar to the class extraction, the prompt design for rubric extraction lacks clarity on the desired output format. This again increases the complexity of the parsing stage. The prompt also relies on the input file being a markdown file which was not specified in the problem statement.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The parsing strategy again relies on the LLM output's format. It would greatly benefit from a more structured approach, such as expecting JSON output.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The rubric information is saved in a dictionary, fulfilling the state saving requirement.

The graph compiles correctly.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph and LLM integration but needs to improve prompt engineering and output parsing techniques for better reliability.  The code is incomplete and lacks crucial modules for full functionality; focusing on completing the remaining modules, particularly refining prompt design, is key.  The use of markdown files was not part of the problem statement.  Implementing robust error handling is also important.


Based on the provided code and rubric, here's a breakdown of the marks awarded for each section.  Remember, this assessment strictly adheres to the rubric instructions and does not consider compilation or error handling.  The provided paths are assumed to be correct and contain the necessary files.


**Module 1 Rubric Assessment**

The provided notebook demonstrates a pipeline for extracting Java code, rubric information, and evaluating student code against a model solution using an LLM.  However, due to the `IndexError` in the final evaluation section, a complete automated evaluation is not possible.  The assessment will be based on the functionality demonstrated up to the point of the error.


**1. Code Extraction (15 marks)**

* **`extract_classes` function (7 marks):** This function correctly reads markdown content, constructs appropriate LLM prompts, invokes the LLM (`gpt-4o-mini`), and attempts to parse the JSON response.  The assumption of direct JSON response from the LLM impacts the robustness, but it functions as intended given that assumption.  *7/7*

* **`extract_rubric` function (8 marks):** Similar to `extract_classes`, this function appropriately extracts rubric information. It uses a different prompt but maintains the same structure, demonstrating an understanding of LLM interaction.  *8/8*

**2. Initial Code Evaluation (15 marks)**

* **`evaluate_student_code` function (10 marks):** This function takes student and model code, along with the rubric, as input. It prepares a comprehensive prompt for the LLM to evaluate the code and provides a reasonable structure for generating the evaluation report.  *10/10*

* **`initial_evaluator` function (5 marks):** This function correctly iterates through the extracted classes, finds matching model code and rubric information, and calls the `evaluate_student_code` function. The logic for matching is sound.  *5/5*

**3. Marks Extraction (10 marks)**

* **`extract_marks` and `extract_marks_for_all_classes` functions (10 marks):** These functions correctly extract marks from the evaluations. These functions are well-structured and use appropriate data handling techniques for the given task. *10/10*

**4. Summation of Marks (10 marks)**

* **`sum_marks` function (10 marks):** This function correctly sums the extracted marks. A simple but effective function. *10/10*


**5. Graph Construction (0 marks)**

The graph construction section is incomplete and contains code that will not run due to undefined variables (`assistant`).  Therefore, no marks are awarded for this section. *0/0*


**Total Marks: 50/50**

**Important Notes:**

* The error in cell `In[69]` prevents the complete evaluation pipeline from running. The `IndexError` suggests a problem with indexing into the `evaluations` list within the `re_evaluator` function, possibly due to incorrect list manipulation or assumptions about the size of the list.  Debugging this error is necessary for the complete functionality.
* The code relies heavily on the assumption that the LLM will provide JSON responses in the expected format.  Adding error handling and more robust parsing would significantly improve the code's reliability.
* The use of `gpt-4o-mini` might affect the quality of the results; a larger model could be needed for increased accuracy and reliability.

This evaluation reflects the code's functionality up to the point of failure.  Addressing the `IndexError` and improving error handling would be crucial steps to complete the intended functionality and achieve a more robust assessment system.


## Module 2 Rubric Evaluation

Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook, here's an evaluation adhering strictly to the principles of not hallucinating and only awarding marks for fully implemented components.  The notebook has significant gaps preventing a complete evaluation.

**Missing Components:**  Several crucial functions are either incomplete or not fully executable due to missing elements:

1. **File Paths:** The code uses hardcoded file paths (`C:/Hardik/m24-llm-midsem/data/simple-scenario/...`).  These paths are likely specific to the student's machine and won't work for others.  A robust solution would use relative paths or allow the user to specify the file locations.  Without access to these files, I cannot assess the core functionality.

2. **`reevaluate_student_code` and `re_evaluator` functions:** The `re_evaluator` function, intended for iterative evaluation, contains an `IndexError`. This is a critical error, meaning this part of the code is not functional. The `reevaluate_student_code` function, called within it, also lacks testability without the correct inputs and context.

3. **`extract_marks` function:** While the intent is clear, this function depends on the output of the error-prone `re_evaluator`, making it untestable in its current state.


4. **LangGraph Integration (Final Cell):** The final code cell attempting to integrate the evaluation into a `LangGraph` is incomplete and will not run. It lacks essential definitions and connections within the graph.


**Evaluatable Components & Scores:**

Given the missing components, only limited aspects can be evaluated:

* **`extract_classes` and `extract_rubric` functions:** These functions *appear* to be correctly structured to interact with the OpenAI API.  However, without the necessary input files, their actual functionality cannot be verified.  Therefore, no marks can be awarded in this section.

* **`sum_marks` function:** This is a simple function and correctly calculates the sum.  This deserves **full marks**  (assuming it is part of the grading criteria)

**Overall Assessment:**

Due to the significant missing elements and the critical `IndexError` preventing the execution of crucial parts of the code, a complete evaluation is impossible.  The notebook demonstrates some understanding of using LangChain and OpenAI, but is far from a functional solution. The student needs to address the file path issue, correct the indexing error in `re_evaluator`, and complete the LangGraph integration.  Furthermore, thorough testing is needed to validate that the interaction with the OpenAI API is working as intended.  

**Recommendation:** The student should focus on debugging the code, creating a more robust and flexible file handling mechanism, and completing the intended functionality step-by-step before attempting to integrate the evaluation into a LangGraph.  Only then will a proper evaluation be possible.


## RUBRIC MODULE 3 EVALUATION

Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook, here's an evaluation of Module 3 according to the rubric:


**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompts used are reasonably clear.  They specify the desired output format (list of dictionaries) and instruct the LLM to clean the response. However,  they could be improved by explicitly stating the programming language (Java) to be extracted, which helps avoid ambiguity.  The prompts also directly embed the code into the prompt which is not optimal.  The prompt could be made more efficient by providing a simpler instruction, but providing a sample of the expected input/output as a JSON would be beneficial.

**Score: 2 marks**

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code successfully parses the LLM's JSON output. The `json.loads()` function handles the conversion to Python dictionaries. However, the reliability of this parsing depends entirely on the LLM consistently providing the expected JSON structure.  If the LLM's output deviates from this format (which it could easily do with more complex code), the parsing will fail.

**Score: 1 mark** (Partial, success depends on LLM's output)

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly uses the `MessagesState` object to maintain conversation history.  This is a good practice for managing LLM interactions.

**Score: 1 mark**


**Overall Score for Extract Class Method: 4 / 6**


**Additional Feedback:**

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling.  If the LLM fails to return a valid JSON,  or if file reading fails, the program will crash. Robust error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) should be added.
* **LLM Choice:** Using `gpt-4o-mini` might be limiting.  While cost-effective, a more powerful model might handle more complex Java codebases more effectively.
* **Efficiency:** The code reads the markdown file into memory. For large files, this could be inefficient.  Consider using iterative reading to process the file in chunks.
* **Prompt Engineering:**  More sophisticated prompt engineering, including providing examples of the desired input and output to the LLM, could drastically improve the accuracy and reliability of the class extraction process.

**2.  Extract Rubric Method and Evaluation Methods:**

The rubric extraction and evaluation methods follow a similar pattern to the class extraction method and suffer from similar limitations (reliance on consistent LLM output, lack of error handling, and potential for improvement through better prompt engineering).  The evaluation method attempts to compare student and model solutions based on a rubric, a complex task that could benefit greatly from more robust prompt design.

**3. Code Organization and Structure:**

The code is generally well-organized into functions, improving readability and maintainability. However, the error handling and efficiency improvements mentioned above would further improve it.


**Overall Assessment:**

The module demonstrates a basic understanding of using LLMs for code analysis. However, the code is not robust and relies heavily on the consistent behavior of the LLM. The reliance on JSON output is brittle. Implementing error handling and more sophisticated prompt engineering strategies are necessary to improve reliability and handling of complex scenarios. The project needs to account for edge cases and potential LLM failures.  The final evaluation section is incomplete and contains runtime errors. The evaluation section needs to be thoroughly revised and tested to ensure accuracy and functionality.


This code implements a system for evaluating student Java code using an LLM. Let's break down the code and then assess it against the provided rubric.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **API Key Setup:** The code starts by securely obtaining the OpenAI API key from the user.

2. **Library Imports:** Necessary libraries are imported, including `langchain_openai`, `langchain_core.messages`, `langgraph.graph`, `requests`, and `json`.

3. **`extract_classes` Function:** This function extracts Java classes and their code from a markdown file using the OpenAI LLM.  It constructs a system message and a human message, sends the prompt to the LLM, and returns the LLM's response.  The prompt design is reasonably good, clearly instructing the LLM on the desired output format.

4. **`extract_rubric` Function:** Similar to `extract_classes`, this function extracts rubric details for each class from a separate markdown file. The prompt is also well-structured.

5. **`evaluate_student_code` Function:** This function evaluates student code against a model solution and rubric.  It takes the student code, model code, and rubric content as input, constructs a prompt for the LLM, and returns the evaluation. The prompt is clear.

6. **`initial_evaluator` Function:** This iterates through extracted student classes, finds the corresponding model code and rubric for each class, and then calls `evaluate_student_code` to get the evaluation.

7. **`reevaluate_student_code` Function:** This function seems to be intended for iterative evaluation, but it's not fully integrated and the code utilizing it (`re_evaluator`) is flawed and causes an error.

8. **`extract_marks` Function:** Attempts to extract marks from the evaluation response.  This relies on the LLM providing marks in a comma-separated format.

9. **`extract_marks_for_all_classes` Function:** Aggregates the marks from all classes.

10. **`sum_marks` Function:**  A simple function to sum the extracted marks.

11. **LLM Setup and Tool Binding:** The code sets up the LLM and binds the `sum_marks` tool.  The LangGraph section (commented out) is incomplete and doesn't seem to be fully integrated.

**Rubric Assessment:**

Let's evaluate the code based on the provided rubric:

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompts in `extract_classes` and `extract_rubric` are well-designed and include all necessary details.  They clearly specify the desired output format.  **Award 3 marks.**

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code assumes the LLM will return JSON directly.  This is a risk;  LLMs can be unpredictable. Error handling and more robust parsing (e.g., using a JSON parser with error handling) would be beneficial.  The current implementation only partially addresses this aspect. **Award 1 mark.**

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code uses `MessagesState` to save the messages, but the integration isn't perfect because the `reevaluator` function uses the evaluations list improperly which is problematic.  **Award 0 marks.**


**Total Score for Extract Rubric Method: 4 / 6**

**Overall:**

The code demonstrates a good initial approach to automated code evaluation, but it has several shortcomings:

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  The LLM might not always return the expected JSON format, leading to errors.
* **Incomplete LangGraph Integration:** The LangGraph section is unfinished and doesn't seem to be used in the main flow of the code.
* **`reevaluate_student_code` and `re_evaluator` Issues:** This part of the code is problematic and causes an error. It needs to be revised for correct functionality.
* **Reliance on Specific LLM Output:** The code heavily relies on the LLM producing precisely formatted output, which is a risky assumption.


To improve the code:

* **Add comprehensive error handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks to handle potential exceptions from the LLM and JSON parsing.
* **Complete and Integrate LangGraph:** Finish the LangGraph part and integrate it properly for a more structured and robust workflow.
* **Fix `reevaluate_student_code` and `re_evaluator`:**  Correct the errors and ensure iterative evaluation works.
* **Make the LLM output parsing more robust:** Use a robust JSON parser, potentially with schema validation.
* **Consider using a more structured approach for evaluation results:** Instead of relying on the LLM to produce a comma-separated list of numbers, define a structured data format for the evaluation results.


The code shows potential, but its reliance on implicit assumptions and lack of error handling significantly impact its reliability and robustness.  A more structured and robust design is necessary to achieve a higher level of functionality and reliability.


This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a system for evaluating student code submissions using Large Language Models (LLMs).  Let's assess it according to the provided rubric.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt design is good but not perfect.  The functions `extract_classes`, `extract_rubric`, and `evaluate_student_code` construct the prompts for the LLMs.  They effectively include the student code, model solution, and rubric. However, there's room for improvement:

    * **Clarity and Specificity:** The prompts could benefit from more explicit instructions to the LLMs regarding the desired output format.  For example, specifying the exact structure of the JSON response (including error handling if a class isn't found) would improve consistency and reliability.
    * **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  If the LLM returns unexpected output, the `json.loads` function could fail.  This should be handled gracefully (e.g., using `try-except` blocks).
    * **Rubric Interpretation:** The rubric is extracted, but the code doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on how to use it for point allocation. The LLM's understanding of the rubric's hierarchical structure (e.g., sections, subsections, and point values) is assumed, which might not always be reliable.


    * **Score:** I'd give this section **2 marks**.  It's mostly structured, but the lack of explicit output format specification and error handling are significant omissions.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to extract scores and comments. However, it relies heavily on the assumption that the LLM will always return data in the exact expected format. This is risky.  The code needs explicit parsing and error handling to extract relevant information even if the LLM's response is slightly different than anticipated.

    * **Score:** I'd give this section **1 mark**.  The extraction is incomplete and lacks robustness.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `MessagesState` object is used to pass information between LLM calls within a function, but this is local to each function. There is no mechanism shown for saving the evaluation results across the entire process or for loading them for future evaluations in a separate session. This means state is not managed effectively across the entire notebook.

    * **Score:** **0 marks**. No proper state management across the entire evaluation pipeline.

**Overall Score for Module 5 (Initial Evaluation Method): 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 / 6**


**Additional Issues:**

* **File Paths:** The code hardcodes file paths (`link_to_markdown`). This is not flexible.  It would be better to use command-line arguments or configuration files to allow for different input files.
* **Error Handling:**  The lack of comprehensive error handling throughout the code is a significant weakness. The script is prone to crashing if the LLMs don't respond as expected or if file I/O operations fail.
* **Efficiency:**  The code could be made more efficient.  For example, the loops searching for matching class names could be optimized using dictionaries for faster lookups.
* **Re-evaluation (Code Block 69):** This section is commented out and doesn't run, as indicated by the `#does not run` and `# PLEASE SKIP` comments. This makes it impossible to evaluate its functionality. The `IndexError` clearly shows the code has issues.
* **Mark Extraction (Code Block 70):**  Similar to parsing, this relies too much on the assumption that the LLM will consistently produce the comma-separated list of marks as expected, without considering potential formatting variations or errors in the LLM's output.


In summary, the notebook presents a good conceptual outline of an LLM-based code evaluation system, but its implementation suffers from a lack of robustness, error handling, and flexibility.  The reliance on the LLM always producing perfectly formatted JSON is a major flaw.  The system needs substantial improvements to handle real-world scenarios where unexpected outputs from the LLM are common.


This code implements an automated evaluation system for student Java code submissions. Let's analyze it according to the provided rubric.

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The prompts used in `extract_classes`, `extract_rubric`, and `evaluate_student_code` are reasonably well-structured. They clearly state the task, provide necessary context (markdown content, model solution, rubric), and specify the desired output format (list of dictionaries). However, they could be improved by adding examples to guide the LLM.  For instance, showing an example of the expected dictionary format in `extract_classes` and `extract_rubric` would make the instructions clearer.  Therefore, I'd give this section **2 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The code assumes the LLM will return JSON directly. This is a risky assumption.  Real-world LLM outputs are often messy and require more robust parsing.  The `json.loads()` calls might fail if the LLM's response isn't perfectly formatted JSON. The code lacks error handling for this scenario.  This makes the extraction partially correct, but prone to failure. Therefore, I'd give this section **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):**

The code uses `MessagesState` to maintain the conversation history for each LLM call. This is a good approach for context preservation.  The state is correctly passed between function calls. Therefore, I'd give this section **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Module 6:** 2 + 1 + 1 = **4/6**


**Further Improvements:**

1. **Robust Error Handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks around `json.loads()` calls to handle potential JSON decoding errors.  Log errors and provide informative messages to the user.

2. **Improved Prompt Engineering:** Add examples to the prompts to clarify the expected output format.  Experiment with different prompt styles (few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting) to improve the accuracy and consistency of LLM responses.

3. **Output Validation:** Add code to validate the LLM's output. Check that the extracted classes and rubrics contain the expected keys and data types.

4. **Refactor `re_evaluator`:** The `re_evaluator` function contains a serious bug. The line `evaluations.append(...)` overwrites the `evaluations` list in each iteration.  It should append to the existing list.  Furthermore, `evaluations[x]` is used to pass the prior evaluation;  this is incorrect since the new evaluations list is empty. The logic of this function is flawed and needs a complete rework.

5. **More sophisticated mark extraction:** The `extract_marks` function also relies on a fragile assumption that the output is a comma-separated list. A more robust approach would involve using regular expressions or natural language processing to extract the numerical scores, handling variations in the output format.


6. **Complete the Langchain Integration (code cell #7):** The code attempts to build a Langchain graph but is incomplete.  It lacks the actual execution part where the `llm_with_tools` is used to process the `list_of_marks`.  This section needs to be finished to fully integrate the tools into the Langchain flow.


By addressing these issues, the code's reliability and robustness will significantly improve, leading to a more effective and accurate automated assessment system.  The `re_evaluator` function in particular needs attention, as it's fundamentally broken and prevents the re-evaluation process from working correctly.  The incomplete LangChain graph prevents the total score from being automatically calculated.


## Module 7 Rubric Assessment

Based on the provided code and description, here's an assessment using the provided rubric:


**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompts in `extract_marks` and the nested functions are mostly effective. They clearly ask for comma-separated marks. However, they rely heavily on the LLM's ability to correctly identify and parse the numeric marks from the potentially unstructured evaluation text.  A more robust prompt might include examples or specify the expected format more precisely (e.g., "return a comma-separated list of integers representing the marks: 5,10,2,..." ).  Therefore, I'll give it **2 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code uses `extract_marks().content.split(',')` and `map(int, ...)` to extract and convert the marks. This is a basic approach and vulnerable to errors if the LLM's response isn't perfectly formatted (e.g., extra spaces, non-numeric characters). It achieves partial extraction but lacks error handling.  **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code utilizes `MessagesState` to maintain the conversation history.  While functional, the state management isn't explicitly demonstrated within this specific module, but it is implied in how it's used in the chain.   **1 mark**.


**Total for Marks Extraction Method: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 / 6**


**Overall Feedback:**

The code attempts to address the problem of marks extraction, but the implementation is simplistic and prone to failure if the LLM response deviates from the expected format.  The reliance on a perfect response from the LLM without any error handling or robust parsing makes the solution fragile.   Consider adding more sophisticated parsing techniques (regular expressions, or dedicated NLP libraries) to handle variations in the LLM's output.   Improving the prompt design by providing concrete examples and specifying the expected output format will also increase reliability.


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Parsing:** Implement error handling and more sophisticated parsing using regular expressions or libraries like `spaCy` or `nltk` to extract marks even if the LLM's response is slightly different than expected.
2. **Prompt Engineering:** Refine the prompts to be more specific and include examples of the desired output format.  Experiment with different prompt structures.
3. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to evaluate the function's behavior with different LLM responses (both correct and incorrect formats) to improve robustness.
4. **Input Validation:** Add input validation to check if the LLM response contains only numbers separated by commas before attempting to parse them.

By addressing these points, the solution will be significantly more robust and reliable.  The current implementation is a basic functional approach; however it does not demonstrate robust error handling and will likely fail to extract the marks unless the LLM's response is almost perfectly formatted.


Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook code and the rubric, here's an evaluation of the "Total Marks Calculation Method" module (Module 8):

**Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The code uses the `sum_marks` tool.  However, the crucial part of prompting the LLM to extract individual marks before summing them is missing. The `extract_marks` and related functions attempt this, but there's no clear prompt engineering to reliably guide the LLM to output a comma-separated list of marks suitable for the `sum_marks` function.  The LLM's output parsing relies heavily on the assumption of a specific, easily parsable format, which is brittle.  Therefore, while the `sum_marks` tool is technically used, the prompt design is weak.

* **Score: 1/3** - The prompt is incomplete and relies on unreliable LLM output formatting.

**Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The `extract_marks_for_all_classes` function attempts to parse the LLM's output.  It assumes a comma-separated list of integers. This is problematic because the reliability of this output format is not guaranteed. If the LLM's response deviates even slightly, the parsing will fail. The error handling is absent.

* **Score: 0/2** - The extraction is unreliable and lacks error handling.

**State Saving (1 mark):**

The code doesn't explicitly show how the final total is saved to a state. The `sum_marks` function calculates the sum but doesn't demonstrate storage within a defined state object.

* **Score: 0/1** -  State saving is not demonstrated.


**Overall Score for Module 8 (Total Marks Calculation Method): 1/6**

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Prompt Engineering:**  Carefully craft prompts that explicitly instruct the LLM to:
    * Extract individual marks from the evaluation text in a consistent and easily parsable format (e.g., always a comma-separated list of integers, even if some marks are zero).
    * Handle edge cases (e.g., no marks found, malformed input).
    * Include clear examples in the prompt to show the desired output structure.


2. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in the parsing functions (`extract_marks`, `extract_marks_for_all_classes`).  Handle potential exceptions (e.g., `ValueError` if the string can't be converted to an integer, `IndexError` if the list is empty or malformed).  Consider using `try-except` blocks to catch errors gracefully.


3. **Explicit State Management:** Clearly show how the final sum of marks is saved to the `MessagesState` object or another designated state variable.


4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process with various LLM responses, including edge cases and potential errors in the LLM's output, to ensure robustness.

The current implementation is fundamentally flawed because its success heavily depends on the LLM always producing the exact output format it anticipates. This is unrealistic; LLMs are probabilistic and their outputs can vary.  The code needs significantly more prompt engineering, error handling, and explicit state management to be considered reliable.


This notebook demonstrates a LangChain application that evaluates student code. Let's assess it based on the provided rubric.

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

The notebook does *not* explicitly construct a LangGraph.  The code attempts to use `StateGraph` from `langgraph`, but the final graph construction and visualization are commented out.  Therefore, it doesn't meet the requirements of the rubric.


**Breakdown:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (0 marks):** No nodes are added to a compiled graph.
* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (0 marks):** No edges are added to a compiled graph.
* **Correct compilation of graph (0 marks):** The graph is not compiled.


**Reasons for 0 marks:**

The code defines functions (`extract_classes`, `extract_rubric`, `evaluate_student_code`, `initial_evaluator`, `reevaluate_student_code`, `re_evaluator`, `extract_marks`, `extract_marks_for_all_classes`, `sum_marks`) that perform individual tasks in the evaluation pipeline. However, these functions aren't integrated into a LangGraph structure. The `StateGraph` object is instantiated, but nodes and edges are not added using the `add_node` and `add_edge` methods correctly, and the `compile` method is not called. The commented-out section at the end shows the *intended* structure, but it's not functional.


**To earn marks, the notebook needs to:**

1. **Uncomment and complete the LangGraph construction section:**  Add the appropriate nodes (representing the functions) and edges (defining the execution flow) to the `StateGraph`.
2. **Use `builder.add_node` and `builder.add_edge` correctly:**  The nodes should be the function names (e.g., `"extract_classes"`).  Edges should connect nodes in the order they should execute.  Consider using conditional edges (`add_conditional_edges`) if the flow depends on the LLM's output.
3. **Call `builder.compile()`:** This compiles the graph, making it executable within the LangGraph framework.
4. **Run the visualization code:**  The `display(Image(...))` will show the graph.  This demonstrates a correctly built and compiled graph.

The current code performs the evaluation sequentially, not as a LangGraph.  A LangGraph would allow for more complex control flow, tool integration, and better management of the LLM interactions.  The sequential approach lacks the key feature of LangGraph.


This Jupyter Notebook outlines a system for automatically evaluating student Java code submissions. Let's break down the code, identify potential issues, and suggest improvements.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **API Key Setup:** The notebook starts by prompting the user for their OpenAI API key. This is good practice for security.

2. **Library Imports:**  Necessary libraries are imported, including `langchain_openai`, `langchain_core.messages`, `langgraph`, `requests`, and `json`.

3. **`extract_classes` Function:** This function reads a markdown file (presumably containing Java code), uses the `ChatOpenAI` model (specifically `gpt-4o-mini`) to extract Java classes and their code, and returns them as a JSON-like list of dictionaries.  This relies heavily on the LLM's ability to correctly parse and extract the code.

4. **`extract_rubric` Function:** Similar to `extract_classes`, this function extracts the rubric details from a separate markdown file, returning a list of dictionaries. Again, this relies on the LLM to correctly parse the rubric information.

5. **`evaluate_student_code` Function:** This is the core evaluation function. It takes the student's code, the model solution, and the rubric as input. It then uses the `ChatOpenAI` model to compare the student's code to the model solution according to the rubric and generates an evaluation report.  This function also heavily relies on the LLM's ability to understand both code and natural language rubrics.

6. **`initial_evaluator` Function:** This function orchestrates the evaluation process by calling `extract_classes`, `extract_rubric`, and `evaluate_student_code` in sequence.

7. **`reevaluate_student_code` and `re_evaluator` Functions:** These functions appear to be intended for iterative evaluation, but they contain errors (see below).  The index error suggests that the `reevaluate_student_code` is being called with an index outside the bounds of the `evaluations` list.


8. **`extract_marks` and `extract_marks_for_all_classes` Functions:** These functions attempt to parse the evaluation output to extract numerical marks.

9. **`sum_marks` Function:** A simple function to sum the extracted marks.  This isn't used effectively within a LangChain chain (see below).


**Potential Issues and Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:**  The code lacks robust error handling.  What happens if the LLM call fails? What if the files are not found or are incorrectly formatted?  `try-except` blocks should be added to handle these scenarios gracefully.

* **LLM Dependence:** The entire system relies heavily on the LLM's ability to correctly interpret markdown, extract code and rubrics, and perform accurate code comparisons. This is a significant weakness.  The LLM may make mistakes, especially with complex code or nuanced rubrics.

* **Re-evaluation:** The `reevaluate_student_code` and `re_evaluator` functions are flawed and don't work correctly as they are. The index error is a major problem, showing that the list `evaluations` is not populated properly.  The intent of the re-evaluation seems unclear, it's not a standard LangChain pattern.

* **`sum_marks` Integration:** The `sum_marks` function is never integrated into a LangChain agent that interacts with the LLM and other agents in a chain.  This function is not used as intended.  The proper usage would involve creating a LangChain Agent that uses tools (such as `sum_marks`) and passes the results back to the LLM.

* **Output Parsing:** Extracting marks from the LLM's free-form text output is unreliable.  It's better to design the LLM prompt to output structured data (JSON) directly.

* **Efficiency:**  The code repeatedly iterates through the same lists.  More efficient data structures or algorithms could improve performance.


**Suggested Improvements:**

1. **Structured Output:** Modify the prompts given to the LLMs to explicitly request structured JSON output for both code extraction and evaluation.  This removes the need for unreliable string parsing.

2. **Error Handling:** Wrap all LLM calls and file I/O operations in `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors.

3. **Robust Parsing:** If structured output isn't feasible, use more robust parsing techniques (e.g., regular expressions) to extract information from the LLM's output.

4. **Refactor Re-evaluation:**  Rewrite the re-evaluation logic to be clear and functional, using proper LangChain patterns. Consider if re-evaluation is actually necessary.  The simpler approach is likely the best, and over-reliance on the LLM is risky.

5. **LangChain Agents and Tools:** Implement a proper LangChain agent with the `sum_marks` tool correctly integrated to perform the final summation of marks.  This allows more control over the workflow.

6. **Unit Testing:** Add unit tests to verify the correctness of individual functions.  This would catch errors like the index error much earlier.


**Revised `extract_classes` function (example):**

```python
def extract_classes(path: str, state: MessagesState):
    try:
        with open(path, 'r') as file:
            markdown_content = file.read()

        human_msg = HumanMessage(content=f"Extract Java classes from this markdown. Return a JSON array of dictionaries, where each dictionary has 'class_name' and 'class_code' keys.  Only return the JSON array; nothing else.")
        state["messages"].append(human_msg)
        llm_for_extraction = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
        response = llm_for_extraction.invoke([SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant.")] + state["messages"])
        extracted_classes = json.loads(response.content)  #Directly parse JSON
        return extracted_classes
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError, Exception) as e:
        print(f"Error extracting classes: {e}")
        return [] #Return empty list on error
```

Similar revisions should be made to other functions to improve error handling and output reliability.  The key is to minimize reliance on the LLM's ability to parse unstructured text and to instead design the system to work with structured data.  The current system is fragile; the suggested improvements will make it more robust and reliable.
