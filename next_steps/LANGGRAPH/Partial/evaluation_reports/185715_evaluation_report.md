## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 45/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [5/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt design effectively instructs the LLM to extract individual Java classes.  It is clear and concise.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The `parse_extracted_classes` function correctly extracts class names and code. The improved regex in the student solution handles various class declarations effectively.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are saved to the state, but there's no explicit error handling or verification to ensure the extraction was successful before moving to the next stage.  This could lead to issues if the LLM fails to extract classes.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [6/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt design is well-structured and effectively guides the LLM to extract relevant rubric details for each class.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The rubric details are correctly extracted and stored.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are correctly saved into the state.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [6/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt provides all necessary information (student code, model solution, rubric) for accurate initial evaluation.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The initial evaluations (scores and comments) are extracted successfully.

**3.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The initial evaluations are properly stored in the state.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [6/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt for review is effective, requesting corrections and a final, comprehensive assessment.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are successfully extracted.

**4.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are properly saved in the state.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [5/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt is clear and successfully guides the LLM to extract marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The regular expression used for extracting marks is improved and handles a wider range of mark formats, but doesn't deal with cases where marks aren't consistently numeric.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
While marks are extracted, no explicit handling exists for cases where the LLM fails to return numeric values.  This is a crucial step where failure to handle malformed LLM output could lead to errors in total marks.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt accurately instructs the LLM to use the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**

The graph compiles and runs without errors, demonstrating successful LangGraph implementation.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student's solution demonstrates a strong understanding of LangGraph and LLM integration. The code is well-structured and mostly functional.  However, error handling, particularly in class extraction and marks extraction, needs improvement to make it more robust. Adding checks for successful LLM invocations and handling cases with missing or non-numeric marks will enhance the application's reliability.


This code is a complex system for automatically evaluating student code.  Let's break down the grading based on the implied rubric (since one isn't explicitly provided, but rather constructed by the code's behavior).  We'll assess functionality and adherence to the instructions.


**Grading Rubric (Implicit, based on code function):**

* **LLM Integration (20 points):**  Correctly uses the LLM to extract classes, rubrics, perform evaluations, and extract marks.  Points deducted for incorrect LLM prompts, poor parsing of LLM outputs, or failure to leverage the LLM effectively in each stage.
* **Workflow Implementation (15 points):**  Correctly implements the LangGraph workflow. This includes defining nodes, edges, and ensuring proper execution flow. Points deducted for missing nodes, incorrect edge connections, or faulty workflow design.
* **Data Handling (10 points):**  Correctly handles the input data (student code, model solution, rubric) and intermediate results. Efficiently stores and manages the `EvaluationState` dictionary. Points deducted for data loss, incorrect data transformation, or improper state management.
* **Output & File Handling (5 points):**  Correctly saves the final evaluations and total marks to "final_evaluations.txt".  Generates and saves the workflow graph (although the actual visual output is secondary).


**Detailed Evaluation:**

* **LLM Integration:** The code shows a reasonable attempt at integrating with the LLM.  However, the success highly depends on the quality and consistency of the LLM's responses. The prompts are generally well-structured.  The `parse_extracted_classes` function attempts to handle the LLM's output, but its robustness might be limited depending on the LLM's formatting.  The regex for mark extraction (`re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)`) is a bit naive and might miss marks expressed in different formats (e.g., "5/5").  **Score: 16 / 20** (Lost 4 points for the limitations in parsing and potential fragility of the mark extraction).

* **Workflow Implementation:** The `StateGraph` is correctly set up with nodes and edges representing the evaluation steps. The workflow execution appears sound.  **Score: 14 / 15** (Lost 1 point for potential issues arising from the dependence on the LLMâ€™s output format; the workflow's robustness depends heavily on this.)

* **Data Handling:** The `EvaluationState` is a well-structured dictionary for tracking state.  The code handles file reading correctly. The handling of marks could be improved (robust error handling). **Score: 9 / 10** (Lost 1 point for the lack of more robust error handling in the marks processing).

* **Output & File Handling:** The final evaluations are saved to a file. The creation of the workflow diagram in Mermaid format is implemented.  **Score: 5 / 5**


**Total Score: 44 / 50**

**Recommendations:**

* **Improve LLM Output Parsing:**  The parsing functions should be more robust and handle variations in LLM output more gracefully.  Consider using more sophisticated parsing techniques (e.g.,  using a library specifically for parsing structured data extracted from text).
* **Robust Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling throughout the code to deal with potential issues such as invalid marks, unexpected LLM responses, or file I/O errors.
* **Mark Extraction Refinement:**  The regex for extracting marks needs improvement to accommodate different formats and to handle cases where marks are not present.  A more sophisticated approach might involve NLP techniques to identify scores within the evaluation text.
* **Unit Testing:**  Adding unit tests would significantly improve the code's maintainability and reliability, allowing for easier identification of bugs and vulnerabilities.



This detailed evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment of the submitted code based on the implied rubric and identifies areas for potential improvement. Remember that the actual score might vary slightly based on how strictly the rubric is interpreted.


This code is a comprehensive automated essay scoring system using LangChain, LangGraph, and Google Generative AI.  However, several improvements can be made to enhance its robustness, accuracy, and usability.  I will evaluate it based on functionality and potential improvements, not on a numerical rubric as none was provided for the code itself.


**Functionality:**

* **LLM Integration:** The code successfully integrates with Google's Gemini API using a provided API key. This allows for leveraging the LLM's capabilities for code parsing, rubric interpretation, and evaluation.
* **Workflow Management:**  LangGraph effectively structures the evaluation process into a series of interconnected nodes.  The workflow is well-defined, proceeding from class extraction to final mark calculation.
* **File Handling:** The `read_file` function efficiently handles reading input files, cleaning up whitespace and empty lines.
* **Custom Tool:** The `sum_marks` tool is a useful addition for aggregating individual class scores.  The error handling is good, preventing crashes on malformed input.
* **Class Extraction:** The `parse_extracted_classes` function attempts to parse the extracted classes from the LLM's output. However, its reliability depends heavily on the consistency of the LLM's response format.  Robust parsing is crucial.
* **Marks Extraction:** The use of regular expressions (`re.findall`) to extract marks is a good approach, but it might miss marks in unusual formats.  More sophisticated parsing might be needed.
* **Output:** The code saves the final evaluations and total marks to a text file, and also generates a workflow diagram.


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Error Handling:** While the `sum_marks` function has error handling, the rest of the code lacks comprehensive error handling.  The LLM might fail, the input files might be missing or malformed, or the parsing might fail.  Adding `try-except` blocks around LLM invocations and file operations is crucial.  Log the errors for debugging purposes.
* **LLM Prompt Engineering:** The prompts given to the LLM could be significantly improved. More specific instructions, examples, and constraints could lead to more accurate and consistent results.  Consider providing example evaluations or specifying the desired format of the LLM's responses.
* **Robust Parsing:** The parsing functions (`parse_extracted_classes`, and the implicit parsing in `marks_extraction`) are vulnerable to variations in the LLM's output.  Consider using more robust parsing techniques, such as using a dedicated parsing library or developing more sophisticated regular expressions.  The current `parse_extracted_classes` could easily fail if the LLM's output changes slightly.
* **Rubric Structure:**  The code assumes a specific structure for the rubric.  A more flexible approach that can handle various rubric formats would be beneficial.
* **Model Solution Comparison:** The comparison between student code and the model solution is entirely dependent on the LLM.  Adding more structured comparison techniques, possibly involving static analysis or diffing tools, could improve accuracy.
* **Configuration:** Hardcoding file paths and the API key is not ideal. Using configuration files would make the code more flexible and maintainable.
* **Dependency Management:** Use a `requirements.txt` file to specify the project's dependencies for easier reproducibility.
* **Testing:**  Adding unit tests to verify the correctness of individual functions and the overall workflow would significantly improve the code's reliability.


**Specific Example of Improvement:**

The `parse_extracted_classes` function relies on the LLM's output consistently starting lines with "class". This is fragile. A more robust method would involve using a proper Java parser or at least a more sophisticated regular expression to reliably identify class definitions, handling various formatting styles.


In summary, the code provides a functional framework for automated essay scoring, but several key improvements are needed to increase its robustness, accuracy, and maintainability.  Addressing the areas for improvement listed above will significantly enhance its capabilities.


This code implements an automated code evaluation system using LangChain and a large language model (LLM). Let's evaluate its `class_extraction` module according to the provided rubric.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in `class_extraction` is: `"Extract individual Java classes from the following code:\n\n{code}\n\nFor each class, provide the class name and its code."`  This prompt is clear, concise, and directly instructs the LLM on the desired task. It effectively uses a placeholder `{code}` to insert the student's code.  Therefore, it receives **3 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `parse_extracted_classes` function attempts to parse the LLM's output.  However, its robustness is questionable.  It relies on the LLM consistently outputting class definitions starting with "class" and following a specific format.  If the LLM's output deviates from this (e.g., due to different formatting or errors), the parsing might fail.  While it makes an attempt at handling multiple classes, edge cases could cause issues.  Therefore, it receives **1 mark**.  A more robust parser using regular expressions or an abstract syntax tree (AST) would be much more reliable.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The extracted classes are correctly saved to `state['extracted_classes']`, demonstrating correct use of state variables. This receives **1 mark**.


**Total Score for Extract Class Method:** 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 marks**


**Improvements:**

1. **Robust Parsing:** Replace the simple `parse_extracted_classes` function with a more robust solution. Regular expressions could identify class declarations more reliably, handling variations in formatting.  Even better, an AST parser could provide a more accurate and complete understanding of the code structure.

2. **Error Handling:** Add error handling in case the LLM fails to extract classes or provides malformed output.  The function should gracefully handle such situations instead of potentially crashing or producing incorrect results.

3. **Prompt Engineering:** While the prompt is good, experimenting with different prompts might improve the LLM's output quality and consistency.  For example, providing examples of the desired output format could be beneficial.

4. **LLM Choice:** The choice of LLM (Gemini) and its parameters (temperature=0) should be carefully considered and possibly experimented with. A different LLM or different settings might produce better results for code extraction.


The code demonstrates a good foundation, but the parsing step needs significant improvement to make the `class_extraction` module truly robust and reliable.  The current implementation is brittle and heavily dependent on the LLM's consistent output format.


The code has several issues that prevent it from achieving a high score on the rubric. Let's analyze each section:

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in `rubric_extraction` is insufficient.  It assumes the rubric contains class-specific details already segmented. A real-world rubric typically describes evaluation criteria applicable across multiple classes. The prompt needs to instruct the LLM to *interpret* the rubric and extract relevant criteria for a given class.  This requires a more sophisticated prompt engineering approach. For example, the prompt should specify what constitutes "relevant rubric details" (e.g., point allocation for specific functionalities, coding style requirements related to the class's purpose).  Currently, it would likely return a portion of the entire rubric rather than the pertinent information for a specific class.  This earns at most **1 mark**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `parse_extracted_classes` function is a good start for parsing class extractions. However, there's no equivalent parser for the rubric extraction. The LLM's output is directly assigned to `state['extracted_rubrics']` without any processing. This makes the code vulnerable to inconsistencies in the LLM's response format.  This is **0 marks**.


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `EvaluationState` correctly stores the extracted rubrics. This earns **1 mark**.

**Overall for Extract Rubric Method:** 1 + 0 + 1 = **2 marks**

**Specific Improvements:**

1. **Improved Prompt for `rubric_extraction`:**

```python
def rubric_extraction(state: EvaluationState, llm: BaseLLM) -> EvaluationState:
    prompt = """
    Given the following rubric and the Java class code below, extract the relevant rubric criteria and their corresponding points for evaluating this specific class.  The rubric may contain general criteria applicable across multiple classes. Focus only on the criteria directly relevant to the functionality and code style within this class.

    Rubric:
    {rubric}

    Class Name: {class_name}
    Class Code:
    {class_code}

    Return the extracted rubric information in a structured format like this:

    Criterion 1: Points Possible (e.g., Correct Implementation of Method X: 5 points)
    Criterion 2: Points Possible
    ...
    """
    for class_name, class_code in state['extracted_classes'].items():
        result = llm.invoke(prompt.format(rubric=state['rubric'], class_name=class_name, class_code=class_code))
        state['extracted_rubrics'][class_name] = result.content
    return state
```

2. **Rubric Parsing Function:**  Add a function to parse the LLM's structured output for the rubric.  This function should handle variations in the LLM's response and extract criteria and points reliably. This might involve regular expressions or other parsing techniques depending on the LLM's output format.


3. **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling for cases where the LLM fails to extract classes or rubrics.  The current code lacks mechanisms for handling LLM errors or unexpected output formats.


4. **Input Validation:**  Sanitize inputs (especially the `rubric` and student code) to prevent unexpected behaviors.


By implementing these improvements, the code's score on the rubric will significantly increase.  The prompt engineering alone is crucial for obtaining accurate rubric extractions.  Remember to test thoroughly with various rubrics and student codes to validate its robustness.


This code implements a workflow for automatically evaluating student code using a large language model (LLM). Let's analyze it against the provided rubric.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The `initial_evaluation` function's prompt is well-structured. It clearly provides the student code, model solution, and rubric to the LLM.  It requests a detailed evaluation with scores and comments. This earns **3 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `marks_extraction` function attempts to extract marks using regular expressions.  However, relying solely on `re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)` is fragile.  The LLM's output format might not always be consistent, and this regex could miss or incorrectly extract marks if the format changes slightly.  A more robust approach would involve either more sophisticated NLP techniques or structured output from the LLM (e.g., JSON). This earns **1 mark**.  The code correctly extracts the evaluations themselves, but the mark extraction is flawed.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `EvaluationState` TypedDict effectively manages the workflow state.  The `save_final_evaluation` function correctly saves the final evaluations and total marks to a file. This earns **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Initial Evaluation Method:** 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 marks**


**Improvements:**

1. **Robust Mark Extraction:**  The biggest weakness is the mark extraction.  Consider these alternatives:

    * **Structured LLM Output:**  Modify the prompts to ask the LLM to return its evaluation in a structured format like JSON.  This would make parsing much easier and more reliable.  For example, the prompt could ask for output like: `{"criterion1": {"score": 2.5, "comment": "..."}, "criterion2": {"score": 1.0, "comment": "..."}}`.

    * **Improved Regular Expressions:** If sticking with regex, make it more context-aware to handle variations in output formatting.  This would likely require multiple regex patterns and more complex logic.

    * **NLP Techniques:** Use more advanced NLP techniques like named entity recognition (NER) to identify and extract numerical scores even if the formatting changes.


2. **Error Handling:** The `sum_marks` function has basic error handling, but it could be improved.  For example, it could log more informative error messages (including the class name where the error occurred) and handle cases where no marks are extracted more gracefully (perhaps defaulting to 0 for that class's marks).

3. **Prompt Engineering:** Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to improve the LLM's accuracy and consistency in providing evaluations and structured output.


4. **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests to verify the functionality of the different modules, especially the parsing and mark extraction parts, to ensure they are robust against different inputs.

5. **Clarity of File Paths:** The hardcoded file paths (`"D:\\llm_exam\\input_2\\..."`) should be made configurable, possibly through command-line arguments or environment variables, to make the code more flexible and reusable.


By addressing these improvements, the robustness and reliability of the automatic evaluation system would significantly increase, leading to a higher score in the rubric.


This code implements an automated code evaluation system using LangChain and a Google Generative AI LLM.  Let's analyze it according to the provided rubric, focusing on the `review_evaluation` function and its impact on the overall evaluation method.

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in `review_evaluation` is:

```python
prompt = (
    "Review and correct if necessary the following evaluation:\n\n{initial_evaluation}\n\n"
    "Provide a final assessment ensuring all evaluations are accurate and complete."
)
```

This prompt is reasonably well-structured. It clearly instructs the LLM to review the initial evaluation and make corrections. However, it could be improved by adding specific instructions on what constitutes an "accurate and complete" assessment, perhaps referencing the rubric's criteria.  This lack of specificity could lead to inconsistent results.

**Score: 2 marks** (Mostly well-structured, missing minor elements).


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The function correctly extracts the LLM's response using `result = llm.invoke(prompt.format(initial_evaluation=initial_eval))`.  The output is directly assigned to `state['final_evaluations'][class_name]`.  There's no sophisticated parsing beyond this. This is adequate but could benefit from more robust error handling and potentially checks for the presence of actual corrections or revised scores.

**Score: 2 marks** (Complete and correct, but lacks robustness).


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `save_final_evaluation` function correctly saves the reviewed evaluations and the total marks to `final_evaluations.txt`.

**Score: 1 mark** (Saves correctly).


**Total Score for Review Evaluation Method: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 marks**

**Improvements for a Higher Score:**

1. **Improved Prompt Design:**  Refine the `review_evaluation` prompt to include more specific instructions:

   ```python
   prompt = (
       "Review and correct if necessary the following evaluation:\n\n{initial_evaluation}\n\n"
       "Referencing the original rubric, provide a final assessment ensuring all evaluations are accurate and complete.  "
       "Specifically address any discrepancies in scoring or justifications. If corrections are made, clearly indicate them."
   )
   ```

2. **Robust Parsing and Output Validation:** After extracting the `final_evaluations`, add checks to ensure the output contains relevant information (e.g., revised scores, justifications).  Consider using regular expressions or more sophisticated natural language processing techniques to extract key information consistently.


3. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling (e.g., `try-except` blocks) to gracefully handle situations where the LLM fails to produce a meaningful response or if the parsing fails.


4. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the `review_evaluation` function and its related components.  This would significantly improve the reliability and maintainability of the system.


By incorporating these improvements, the code's robustness and the accuracy of its evaluation process would be significantly enhanced, leading to a higher score on the rubric.  The current implementation is functional but lacks the precision and robustness expected for a high-scoring solution.


The code has a good structure and uses LangGraph effectively. However, the marks extraction part could be improved significantly in terms of robustness and accuracy.  The prompt design is weak, and the parsing relies heavily on assumptions about the LLM's output format.


Here's a breakdown of the rubric assessment and suggestions for improvement:


**5. Marks Extraction Method:**

* **Prompt Design (1 mark):** The prompt `"From the following evaluation, extract a comma-separated list of marks awarded for each criterion:\n\n{evaluation}"` is too simplistic and prone to failure.  It doesn't instruct the LLM on how to handle variations in evaluation text formats.  A much more robust prompt would provide examples of different evaluation formats and explicitly instruct the LLM to extract only numerical values representing marks, even if they're embedded in sentences.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** `re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)` is a fragile approach. It assumes marks are always standalone numbers.  Evaluations often contain numbers that are not marks (e.g., line numbers, years).  The code lacks error handling for cases where no marks are found, leading to potential crashes or incorrect results.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** State saving of marks is correctly implemented.


**Improved `marks_extraction` function:**

```python
def marks_extraction(state: EvaluationState, llm: BaseLLM) -> EvaluationState:
    prompt = """Extract all numerical marks from the following evaluation.  Marks may be presented in various ways (e.g., "Score: 8.5", "Criterion 1: 7", "Points Awarded: 10/10 (10)"). Return only the numerical marks separated by commas.  If no marks are found, return "0".

Examples:
Evaluation: "Criterion 1: 7, Criterion 2: 8.5, Criterion 3: 10"  Output: "7,8.5,10"
Evaluation: "Score: 8.5 out of 10" Output: "8.5"
Evaluation: "No marks awarded" Output: "0"

Evaluation:
{evaluation}
"""

    for class_name, evaluation in state['final_evaluations'].items():
        result = llm.invoke(prompt.format(evaluation=evaluation))
        extracted_marks = result.content.strip()

        # Basic validation: check for unexpected characters
        if not re.fullmatch(r'^(\d+(\.\d+)?)(,\d+(\.\d+)?)*$', extracted_marks) and extracted_marks != "0":
            print(f"Warning: Unexpected output from LLM for class {class_name}: {extracted_marks}. Using 0.")
            state['extracted_marks'][class_name] = "0"
        else:
            state['extracted_marks'][class_name] = extracted_marks

    return state

```

This improved version includes:

* **A much more informative and robust prompt:** It gives examples, explains how marks might be formatted, and handles the case where no marks are found explicitly.
* **Improved parsing:** While still relying on the LLM's output, it adds a basic validation step using regular expressions to catch unexpected characters.  It defaults to "0" if the extraction fails.
* **Explicit Error Handling:**  It explicitly handles the situation where the LLM does not return a comma separated list of numbers.



**Overall:**

To achieve a higher mark, focus on improving the prompt design and parsing for the `marks_extraction` function. Consider adding more sophisticated error handling and potentially exploring alternative techniques to extract marks, such as using an LLM to parse the text into a structured format (e.g., a JSON object) before extracting the numerical values.  Consider using a more robust library for parsing if you need more sophisticated natural language processing capabilities. The current implementation is too reliant on the assumption that the LLM will always provide perfectly formatted output.


The code is well-structured and uses LangGraph effectively to manage the evaluation workflow. However, the `total_marks_calculation` function and its interaction with the `sum_marks` tool need improvement to fully satisfy the rubric's requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the rubric assessment and suggested improvements:


**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt within `total_marks_calculation` is excellent. It directly uses the `sum_marks` tool, passing in the concatenated marks string.  This earns **3 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The extraction of the sum is perfectly correct. The `sum_marks.invoke(all_marks)` line directly retrieves the result. This earns **2 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The final total is correctly saved into `state['total_marks']`. This earns **1 mark**.

**Total: 6 / 6**


**Areas for Improvement (Not affecting the rubric score but enhancing robustness):**

1. **Error Handling in `sum_marks`:** While the `sum_marks` function handles `ValueError` if a non-numeric string is encountered, it only prints a warning.  Consider raising a more informative exception or returning a special value (like `None` or -1) to indicate an error and halt the workflow gracefully if a critical error occurs in mark extraction.  This would prevent unexpected results.

2. **Robust Mark Extraction in `marks_extraction`:** The regular expression `re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)` might be too simplistic.  Consider cases where marks might be embedded in more complex sentences or include non-breaking spaces. A more robust approach might involve Named Entity Recognition (NER) or a more sophisticated parsing technique to reliably extract marks.

3. **Input Validation:** The `sum_marks` function implicitly assumes comma-separated marks.  While the current workflow ensures this, adding explicit input validation to the `sum_marks` function (e.g., checking if the input string is empty or contains only commas) could further increase robustness.


**Revised `sum_marks` function (with improved error handling):**

```python
@tool
def sum_marks(marks: str) -> float:
    """Sums a comma-separated list of marks, raising an exception if input is invalid."""
    if not marks:
        raise ValueError("Input string for marks is empty.")
    total = 0.0
    for mark in marks.split(','):
        mark = mark.strip()
        if mark:
            try:
                total += float(mark)
            except ValueError as e:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid mark found: '{mark}' - {e}") from None  # More informative error
    return total
```

By incorporating these improvements, the code will be more robust and reliable, handling unexpected input and edge cases more effectively.  The current solution is functional and receives full marks according to the provided rubric, but these improvements would make it production-ready.


This code implements a LangChain workflow using LangGraph for automated student code evaluation. Let's analyze it against the provided rubric and suggest improvements.

**Rubric Assessment:**

* **7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

    * **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  5 marks. All modules (`class_extraction`, `rubric_extraction`, `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`, `marks_extraction`, `total_marks_calculation`) are correctly added as nodes.

    * **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** 5 marks. All edges representing the correct sequential workflow are correctly added.

    * **Correct compilation of the graph (4 marks):** 4 marks. The graph is correctly compiled using `workflow.compile()`.


**Total Score for Graph Construction: 14/14**


**Code Improvements and Suggestions:**

1. **Error Handling:** The `sum_marks` function includes basic error handling for non-numeric values.  However, more robust error handling should be added throughout the code.  For instance:

   * **LLM errors:**  The code doesn't handle potential errors from the LLM calls (`llm.invoke()`).  These calls could fail due to network issues, API limits, or invalid prompts.  Wrap these calls in `try...except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
   * **File I/O:**  The `read_file` function could include error handling for file not found or permission errors.

2. **Prompt Engineering:** The prompts used for the LLM are reasonably good, but could be improved.  Consider these points:

   * **Specificity:**  The prompts could be more specific in their instructions to the LLM, reducing ambiguity and improving the quality of responses.  For example, in `parse_extracted_classes`, explicitly defining the expected output format would help.
   * **Examples:** Including example input and output in the prompts can significantly improve the LLM's understanding and performance.

3. **`parse_extracted_classes` Function:** This function is prone to errors if the LLM's output isn't perfectly formatted.  Consider using a more robust parsing technique, potentially leveraging regular expressions or a dedicated parsing library, to handle variations in the LLM's response.


4. **Dependency Management:** The code directly uses a Google API key.  Consider using environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys, separating them from the codebase for better security.

5. **Modularization:** The code could be made more modular by separating the LLM interaction logic from the workflow management. This would enhance readability and maintainability.

6. **Logging:** Adding logging statements throughout the code would help in debugging and monitoring the workflow's progress.


**Revised `main` function with some improvements:**

```python
def main():
    try:
        # ... (LLM initialization and state initialization remain the same)

        # ... (workflow creation remains the same)


        # Run the workflow with error handling
        try:
            end_state = app.invoke(initial_state)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during workflow execution: {e}")
            return

        # Save final evaluation (with error handling)
        try:
            save_final_evaluation(end_state)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error saving final evaluation: {e}")
            return

        # ... (rest of the main function remains the same)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

```

By addressing these improvements, the code will become more robust, maintainable, and easier to extend.  Remember to incorporate comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the entire codebase.


This code is a robust attempt at automating the evaluation of student code using a large language model (LLM).  However, it has several areas for improvement:

**Major Issues:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling.  The `sum_marks` function has a `try-except` block, but many other parts could fail (e.g., network issues with the Google AI API, LLM returning unexpected output, file I/O errors).  Robust error handling with informative error messages is crucial for a production-ready system.

2. **API Key Security:** Hardcoding the Google API key directly in the code is a significant security risk.  This key should be stored securely as an environment variable.

3. **LLM Prompt Engineering:** The prompts are a good starting point, but they could be significantly improved.  More structured prompts with clear instructions and examples would lead to more reliable and consistent results from the LLM.  Consider adding specific instructions on the desired format of the output (e.g., JSON for easier parsing).

4. **Output Parsing:** The `parse_extracted_classes` function is a simple attempt at parsing the LLM's output.  It's likely to fail if the LLM's response deviates even slightly from the expected format.  A more robust parser (potentially using a dedicated parsing library) is needed, especially for the evaluation and marks extraction.  Regular expressions are used later, but they're fragile and might miss edge cases.

5. **Dependency Management:** The code relies on several external libraries (`langgraph`, `langchain_core`, `langchain_google_genai`).  It would be beneficial to manage these dependencies using a tool like `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file.

6. **Code Clarity and Style:** While the code is functional, it could benefit from improved clarity and adherence to Python style guidelines (PEP 8).  For instance, more descriptive variable names and better commenting would enhance readability.

7. **Testing:**  No unit tests are included.  Adding tests would improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.


**Minor Issues:**

* **Redundant `marking_scheme` in `initial_state`:** The `marking_scheme` and `rubric` seem to be the same.  Only one is needed.
* **Hardcoded File Paths:** The file paths for input files are hardcoded. It's better to make them configurable (e.g., using command-line arguments).


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

* **Implement robust error handling:** Wrap LLM calls, file I/O, and other potentially failing operations in `try-except` blocks.
* **Use environment variables for API keys:** Store the Google API key in an environment variable (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
* **Refine LLM prompts:**  Make prompts more structured and provide examples. Consider using a few-shot prompting technique.
* **Develop robust parsers:** Use dedicated parsing libraries or more sophisticated regular expressions to handle the LLM's output reliably. Consider using a structured output format from the LLM (like JSON).
* **Manage dependencies with `pip` and `requirements.txt`:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries.
* **Improve code style and readability:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines.
* **Add unit tests:** Write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
* **Make file paths configurable:** Use command-line arguments or configuration files.


By addressing these issues, you can create a much more reliable, secure, and maintainable automatic code evaluation system.  The current implementation is a good starting point, but it requires significant improvements to be truly robust and production-ready.
