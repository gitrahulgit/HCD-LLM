## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [2/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract classes, but lacks precision in specifying the desired output format.  A clearer JSON structure example would improve the results.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM output, but the parsing logic is insufficient for reliably extracting class information. The result is not in the expected format.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not properly saved into the `EvaluationState`.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The prompt design is incomplete. It relies on a hardcoded rubric which isn't dynamic and doesn't appropriately handle the input rubric from the provided files.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No rubric details are extracted due to the lack of a functional prompt and extraction mechanism.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving occurs as no rubric information is extracted.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The prompt design is not fully implemented and uses a hardcoded rubric.  It also doesn't clearly specify the expected output format for evaluations (scores and comments).

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No evaluation is performed, and no score or comments are extracted.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving occurs due to the lack of initial evaluation results.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The prompt for reviewing the evaluation is incomplete and not connected to the preceding modules.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No review of evaluations takes place, leading to no extracted data.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving occurs due to the lack of a review evaluation step.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The prompt for mark extraction is rudimentary and lacks a clear specification of the desired output format (comma-separated list).

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
Marks are not extracted from the evaluations because no evaluations are produced.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving happens since no marks are extracted.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [2/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt for using the `sum_marks` tool is present, but its connection to the mark extraction module is missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Partial implementation: The `sum_marks` tool is defined, but the final sum is not correctly extracted due to missing input from the previous modules.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
Final marks are not saved as the calculation is not completed successfully.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly adds nodes to the LangGraph, representing different modules in the evaluation process.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges connecting the nodes appropriately represent the workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles successfully.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph's structure and successfully sets up the graph's nodes and edges. However, the core logic within each module (prompt engineering, output parsing, and state management) is incomplete and needs significant improvement.  Focus on refining prompts for LLM interaction and implementing robust parsing logic to correctly extract and utilize the information.  Ensure proper state management between modules.


Based on the provided code and the rubric's instructions, here's a marking scheme.  Note that I cannot *execute* the code, so this assessment is based purely on code inspection and the rubric's criteria.


**Module 1 Grading Rubric**

The rubric requires evaluation across several stages, each with potential points.  Since the LLM responses are missing or empty in the execution output, I'll assess based on the *potential* for correct functionality of each stage.


**1. Class Extraction (class-extractor node):**

* **Total Marks Possible:** 10 (5 for model, 5 for submission)
* **Marks Awarded:** 0 (LLM response is empty).  The code *appears* to be correctly structured to extract classes, however, without the LLM's output, it's impossible to assess its success.


**2. Rubric Extraction (rubric-extractor node):**

* **Total Marks Possible:** 10 (5 for model, 5 for submission)
* **Marks Awarded:** 0 (LLM response is empty). The code structure looks correct for this task, but without the LLM output, I cannot assess if it correctly extracted the rubric details.


**3. Initial Evaluation (initial-evaluation node):**

* **Total Marks Possible:** 50 (Based on the rubric's individual items; the code *potentially* correctly handles this).
* **Marks Awarded:** 0 (LLM response is empty).  The agent setup seems correctly designed to provide an evaluation;  however, we lack the LLM's output to assess correctness.


**4. Review Evaluation (review-evaluation node):**

* **Total Marks Possible:** 10 (5 for model, 5 for submission; based on potential adjustments to initial evaluations).
* **Marks Awarded:** 0 (LLM response is empty). Similar to the previous step, the code's structure is sound, but no output is available for evaluation.


**5. Marks Extraction (extract-marks node):**

* **Total Marks Possible:** 5 (2.5 for model, 2.5 for submission)
* **Marks Awarded:** 0 (LLM response is empty).  The code is designed to extract marks; however, without the LLM output, I can't verify its functionality.


**6. Total Marks Calculation (total-marks node + sum_marks tool):**

* **Total Marks Possible:** 5
* **Marks Awarded:** 0 (LLM response is empty).  The `sum_marks` tool is correctly defined, and the node setup *should* calculate total marks correctly, but the lack of LLM output prevents assessment.


**Overall Total Marks:** 0 / 80


**Comments:**

The Python code implementing the Langchain workflow appears well-structured and correctly designed to achieve the intended functionality according to the rubric. The use of `ChatPromptTemplate`, Langchain tools and StateGraph is appropriate. However, the absence of LLM responses (due to the empty responses noted in the output) prevents any meaningful evaluation of the *actual* performance of the system. The code itself, in isolation, demonstrates a reasonable approach to the problem.  A successful run with populated LLM responses is needed for a fair score.


## Module 2 Rubric Evaluation

This evaluation assesses the student's implementation based on the provided code and expected functionality.  Due to the asynchronous nature of the code and the reliance on external APIs (Google Gemini), a complete evaluation requires execution of the notebook.  However, I can provide a rubric-based assessment based on the code structure and design.


**Grading Rubric:**  (Assuming a 100-point scale.  Adjust weights as needed.)

**I. Code Structure and Design (40 points)**

* **A.  Modular Design (15 points):**
    *  (5 points)  Code is well-organized into functions with clear responsibilities.  - **Partial Credit:** Functions exist but some lack clear separation of concerns.  **No Credit:** Code is monolithic and lacks significant function decomposition.
    *  (5 points)  Use of `TypedDict` for state improves code readability and type safety. - **Partial Credit:** `TypedDict` is used, but types are incomplete or inaccurate.  **No Credit:**  No `TypedDict` used.
    *  (5 points)  Effective use of `partial` for creating agent nodes improves code conciseness. - **Partial Credit:** `Partial` is used, but its implementation could be improved.  **No Credit:**  `Partial` not used effectively.

* **B. Agent Creation and Invocation (15 points):**
    * (5 points) `create_agent` function correctly creates and configures Langchain agents based on the provided parameters. - **Partial Credit:** Function creates an agent, but handles parameter variations poorly or lacks error handling.  **No Credit:**  Agent creation is fundamentally flawed.
    * (5 points)  `agent_node` correctly invokes the agent and formats the response as an `AIMessage`. - **Partial Credit:** Agent invocation succeeds, but response formatting is incorrect or incomplete. **No Credit:**  Agent invocation fails or the response is improperly handled.
    * (5 points)  System messages are appropriately defined and clear for each agent. - **Partial Credit:** System messages are present but lack detail or clarity. **No Credit:** System messages are missing or extremely poorly written.

* **C. Workflow Implementation (10 points):**
    * (5 points) `StateGraph` is correctly used to represent the workflow. - **Partial Credit:**  `StateGraph` is used but with errors in edge definitions or node configuration.  **No Credit:** `StateGraph` is not used or used incorrectly.
    * (5 points) The routing logic (`router`) correctly manages the flow between agents. - **Partial Credit:** Routing is partially functional, with some errors or missing transitions.  **No Credit:** Routing logic is severely flawed or non-functional.



**II.  Agent Functionality (60 points)**

* **A.  Class Extraction Agent (10 points):**  This requires executing the notebook and verifying whether the agent successfully extracts class information from Java files and formats it as JSON.

* **B. Rubric Extraction Agent (10 points):** This requires executing the notebook and verifying whether the agent correctly extracts rubric details from the provided Markdown file and formats it as JSON.

* **C. Initial Evaluation Agent (15 points):** This requires executing the notebook and verifying whether the agent evaluates the code based on the rubric, assigning appropriate marks and comments.

* **D. Review Evaluation Agent (10 points):**  This requires executing the notebook and verifying whether the agent correctly reviews and potentially updates the evaluation results.

* **E. Marks Extraction and Totaling Agents (15 points):** This requires executing the notebook and verifying if the agents extract marks, calculate the sum correctly using the tool, and return results in the specified format.



**III. Error Handling and Robustness (0 points)** (This section could be added to the rubric for a more comprehensive assessment)


**Overall Grade:** To determine the overall grade, sum the points earned in each section. The maximum score is 100.  Note that significant points are contingent upon the successful execution and testing of the asynchronous agent workflow and its interaction with the Google Gemini API.  Without execution and testing, only the code structure and design can be fully evaluated.  The detailed functionality of each agent can only be assessed after running the code and observing its output with appropriate sample inputs.


The provided code implements a complex workflow using Langchain and a LLM to evaluate student code against a rubric.  Let's assess Module 3 based on the rubric.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design is fairly good. It clearly instructs the LLM to extract Java classes from both the model and student solutions and specifies the desired JSON output format.  However, it relies on the LLM to correctly understand the concept of "imports" and "class" within the context of Java.  There's no explicit handling for potential errors or edge cases (e.g., multiple classes in a file).  Therefore, I'd give this a **2 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code successfully extracts and structures the output in the specified JSON format *if* the LLM provides the correct information. The success heavily depends on the accuracy of the LLM's response. We don't know if the LLM parsing is always accurate based on this code. Thus, it gets a **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code uses a `TypedDict` (State) and includes `add_messages` which is used correctly to save the extracted class information. This receives **1 mark**.

**Overall Module 3 Score:** 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 marks out of 6**

**Improvements:**

1. **Robust Prompt Engineering:** The prompt needs significant improvement.  Consider these enhancements:

   * **Example Input/Output:** Include a clear example of a Java class and the corresponding desired JSON output in the prompt.  This helps the LLM understand the task better.
   * **Error Handling:** Add instructions to the prompt to explicitly handle cases where class extraction fails (e.g., invalid Java code, multiple classes).  The output should indicate if a class extraction was successful or failed along with an error message.  The LLM could be instructed to return a specific JSON structure to signal an error
   * **Explicit Instructions on Imports:** Specify what constitutes an "import" – should it be a complete list or a structured representation?
   * **Handling Multiple Classes:**  The current prompt doesn't specify how to handle files with multiple classes. The prompt should instruct the LLM to only extract the class relevant to the assignment.

2. **LLM Response Validation:**  Add code to validate the LLM's JSON response to ensure that it conforms to the expected structure.  Simple checks can be implemented to confirm the presence of the required keys ("model", "submission", "imports", "class").  If the JSON is malformed, the workflow should gracefully handle it (e.g., log an error, or retry the prompt with additional guidance).

3. **Modular Design:** The code could benefit from a more modular design. Separate functions could be created for prompt generation, LLM interaction, JSON parsing and validation.  This improves readability and maintainability.


By addressing these improvements, the robustness and reliability of the class extraction module would increase significantly.  This would lead to a higher score on the rubric in a revised assessment.


The provided code implements a LangChain workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's analyze Module 4's "Extract Rubric Method" based on the rubric provided.

**1. Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The prompt in `system_message` within the `rubric_extractor_agent` is fairly well-designed. It clearly instructs the LLM to extract rubric details, specifying the desired JSON output format.  It includes the rubric itself using `{rubric}`, which is a crucial element.  However, it lacks explicit instructions on handling potential variations or ambiguities in the rubric's format.  The assumption is made that the rubric will be in a consistent format which might not always be true. A more robust prompt would include instructions on how to handle missing information or different rubric structures.

**Score: 2 marks.**  Mostly complete, but lacks robustness handling variations in rubric format.


**2. Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The code attempts to extract rubric details from the LLM's response.  However, the crucial step of extracting the JSON output from the LLM's response is missing.  The code simply passes the `rubric` to the LLM and then moves on.  There's no code to parse the LLM's response and extract the relevant information.  The `agent_node` function receives the LLM output but doesn't perform any JSON parsing.

**Score: 0 marks.** Extraction fails due to missing parsing logic.


**3. State Saving (1 mark):**

The `MemorySaver()` is used, suggesting an intention to save the rubric details. However,  because the rubric extraction itself fails (due to point 2), the state isn't correctly saved with the extracted rubric details.  The `State` dictionary is updated, but it doesn't contain the processed rubric data.

**Score: 0 marks.** Not saved or improperly stored.


**Overall Module 4 Score: 2 / 6**

The main weakness lies in the absence of JSON parsing logic in the `rubric_extractor_node` to handle the LLM's response. This needs to be added to successfully extract the rubric details.  The prompt could also be improved to handle a broader range of rubric formats.  Adding explicit error handling would further enhance robustness.  The state saving mechanism is present but ineffective due to the missing extraction step.


This code implements a Langchain workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's analyze it against the provided rubric.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompts for `class_extractor_agent`, `rubric_extractor_agent`, `initial_eval_agent`, and `review_eval_agent` are well-structured. They clearly define the task, provide necessary context (rubric, model solution, and expected output format), and guide the LLM effectively.  They include placeholders for dynamic inputs.  **Score: 3 marks**

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code does *not* explicitly parse the JSON responses from the LLM. It relies on the LLM to provide correctly formatted JSON.  While the prompts instruct the LLM to return JSON, there's no error handling or parsing in the Python code to deal with malformed or unexpected output. This is a significant weakness. If the LLM's response isn't perfect JSON, the subsequent nodes will likely fail.  **Score: 1 mark** (Incomplete extraction; relies entirely on perfect LLM output).

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `MemorySaver()` is used, indicating an attempt at state management. The `State` TypedDict is used to pass data between nodes. However, the effectiveness of this depends heavily on the LLM producing consistent and correctly structured JSON at each step.  **Score: 1 mark** (Correct state management mechanism implemented, but success depends on LLM output).

**Overall Score for Initial Evaluation Method: 5 / 6**

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Robust JSON Parsing:** Implement robust JSON parsing using a library like `json` to handle potential errors in the LLM's output.  Include error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to gracefully handle cases where the LLM returns invalid JSON.  This is critical for the reliability of the entire workflow.

2. **Schema Validation:** Consider using a JSON schema validator to ensure the LLM's responses conform to the expected structure. This will add another layer of error detection and improve the robustness of the system.

3. **LLM Response Verification:** The `review_eval_agent` aims to verify the evaluation, but its effectiveness relies on the LLM's ability to accurately assess its own previous work. This is prone to error.  Consider adding more rigorous checks within the Python code to validate the scores and comments against the rubric.

4. **Clearer Output:** The output to the console is a mix of raw LLM responses and other debug information.  Structure the final output for better readability, possibly presenting the final scores and comments in a more user-friendly format.


By addressing these points, the robustness and reliability of the code will be significantly enhanced, leading to a higher score on the rubric. The current implementation is functional, but it's vulnerable to failure due to the reliance on perfect LLM output.


The code implements a workflow for evaluating Java code using a large language model (LLM). Let's analyze it against the provided rubric.

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The prompt for the `review_eval_agent` (lines 199-226) is decent. It clearly instructs the LLM to verify the evaluation, make corrections if needed, and return updated marks and comments in JSON format.  However, it could be improved by providing specific examples of what constitutes an inappropriate evaluation or how to handle discrepancies.  For instance, specifying that the LLM should justify its changes would enhance the quality of feedback.  Therefore, I'd give it a **2 marks**.  The system message clearly explains the task to the LLM but lacks concrete examples.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The code doesn't explicitly show how the reviewed evaluation is extracted from the LLM's response.  It relies on the LLM to produce JSON in the specified format.  There's no error handling or parsing of the JSON response to ensure its correctness.  This is a significant weakness.  The code assumes perfect JSON output. Therefore, I'd give it **1 mark**.  Partial extraction because it relies on the LLM's output.

* **State Saving (1 mark):**

The `MemorySaver()` is used (line 113), indicating that the reviewed evaluation is saved.  However, the code doesn't explicitly show *how* it's saved or accessed later.  Assuming `MemorySaver` correctly handles this, this component receives **1 mark**.


**Total for Review Evaluation Method: 4 marks (2 + 1 + 1)**

**Overall Assessment:**

The code presents a reasonable structure for automated code evaluation. The use of a state graph and agents is a good approach.  However, the reliance on perfect LLM outputs without error handling or robust parsing mechanisms is a critical flaw.  The prompt design, while adequate, could be much more specific and directive to elicit higher-quality feedback from the LLM.  The missing error handling and parsing are the most significant issues.  A better implementation would include explicit JSON parsing and validation to handle potential errors in the LLM's response and provide fallback mechanisms.  Furthermore, the prompt could include examples of both correct and incorrect evaluations and explicit instructions on how to justify changes.


The provided code implements a complex workflow for automated code grading using a large language model (LLM). Let's analyze the `Marks Extraction Method` according to the rubric.

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt for `extract_marks_agent` (cell 6) is:

```
You are an assistant responsible for extracting the marks key from the input JSON data. Extract the marks as a comma-separated list. Return the data in the below JSON format.

OUTPUT FORMAT
```json
{
    "model": [1, 2, 3],
    "submission": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
This prompt is **mostly complete (2 marks)**.  It clearly instructs the LLM on the task, specifying the desired output format. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating that the input will be JSON containing "model" and "submission" keys, each with a nested dictionary containing a "marks" key with a list of integers as its value.  This added clarity would make the prompt more robust and less prone to errors if the input JSON structure varies slightly.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code does not explicitly handle the parsing of the LLM's response to extract the marks.  It relies on the LLM providing perfectly formatted JSON.  This is a major weakness.  There's no error handling or robust parsing.  If the LLM's output is even slightly malformed, the code will likely fail. Therefore, this receives **0 marks**.  A proper solution would involve using a JSON parsing library (like `json`) to safely extract the marks and handle potential errors gracefully.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code uses `MemorySaver()` for state management.  While this is present, its effectiveness in the context of marks extraction isn't explicitly shown. The `extract_marks_node` function doesn't show any explicit saving of the extracted marks to the overall state. Therefore, it receives **0 marks**. To get the full mark, it needs to demonstrate clear and correct state saving after extraction.


**Overall Marks for Marks Extraction Method:** 2 + 0 + 0 = **2 marks**

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Improve Prompt Clarity:**  Add more detail to the prompt, specifying the exact structure of the expected input JSON.
2. **Implement Robust Parsing:** Use a JSON parsing library (`json`) to extract the marks from the LLM's response, handling potential exceptions (e.g., `json.JSONDecodeError`).  Add error handling and logging to improve the robustness.
3. **Explicit State Saving:** Modify `extract_marks_node` to explicitly save the extracted marks to the overall state using the `State` dictionary.  This might involve adding a new key to `State` (e.g., `"extracted_marks"`) or updating existing keys.  Make sure the changes propagate correctly through the rest of the workflow.
4. **Testing:** Add thorough testing to ensure the marks extraction works correctly with various inputs (including edge cases and potential errors from the LLM).


By addressing these points, the code's reliability and adherence to the rubric will significantly increase.  The current implementation is fragile and relies heavily on perfect LLM behavior, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios.


The provided code implements a complex workflow for automated code grading. Let's analyze the `Total Marks Calculation Method` based on the rubric:


**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt for the `total_marks_agent` is designed to use the `sum_marks` tool.  However, it doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to *use the output from the "extract-marks" stage as input for sum_marks*.  It only states to use the tool without specifying the input source. This is a significant gap.  The prompt should be more explicit.

   * **Rating:** 2 marks (Mostly proper, minor gaps).


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to extract the final sum, but because the LLM isn't reliably providing the expected JSON, the extraction will often fail. The code depends on the structure of the LLM's output; if the LLM responds with an empty string or a different structure, the extraction will be incorrect or fail completely.  Error handling is missing to gracefully handle these cases.


   * **Rating:** 0 marks (Incorrect or no extraction - due to unreliability of LLM and lack of error handling).


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `memory` object (MemorySaver) is used for state saving, implying the total will be saved somewhere.  However,  it's not clear from the code how the final sum is actually stored or accessed post-execution. The workflow is designed to stop at "total-marks", which has the sum, but there isn't explicit code to save the `sum_marks` result.


   * **Rating:** 0 marks (Incorrect or missing state).


**Overall Score for Module 8, Section 6:** 2 + 0 + 0 = 2 marks


**Improvements:**

1. **Improve Prompt:** The `total_marks_agent` prompt must explicitly tell the LLM to use the `sum_marks` tool and clearly state the input should be the "marks" arrays from the JSON output of the "extract-marks" node. It should handle cases where the input is missing or malformed.


2. **Robust Parsing:** Implement robust error handling and parsing of the LLM's responses.  Instead of assuming a specific JSON structure, check for the existence of the keys ("model", "submission") and their values, handling cases where they are missing or have the incorrect type.  Consider using a JSON library to parse and validate the response before attempting to extract the marks.

3. **Explicit State Saving:**  Add explicit code after the "total-marks" node to store the result of `sum_marks` in the `memory` object or some other designated storage. Define how this stored value will be accessed later.


4. **Logging and Debugging:** Add logging statements to track the LLM's responses at each stage and the extracted values. This will aid in debugging any issues with parsing or LLM behavior.

5. **Unit Testing:** Create unit tests to verify that the `sum_marks` tool works correctly and that the parsing and state saving mechanisms function as intended. Test the workflow under various conditions (correct JSON, empty JSON, malformed JSON, etc.).


By addressing these issues, the reliability and accuracy of the total marks calculation will be greatly improved, leading to a higher score on the rubric.


## Rubric Assessment for Module 9

Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook, here's an assessment using the provided rubric:


**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The notebook correctly adds all the necessary nodes ("class-extractor", "rubric-extractor", "initial-evaluation", "review-evaluation", "extract-marks", "total-marks", "call_tool").  Therefore, **5 marks** are awarded.

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The notebook establishes the correct sequence of edges between the nodes, representing the workflow.  It also cleverly handles the conditional edge from "total-marks" to "call_tool" and back. Therefore, **5 marks** are awarded.

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The graph is compiled using `workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)`.  The compilation appears successful, although the lack of error messages doesn't definitively prove the absence of underlying issues.  The generation of "graph.png" suggests successful compilation. Therefore, **4 marks** are awarded.


**Total Marks for Graph Construction: 14 / 14**


**Overall Comments:**

The code demonstrates a robust and well-structured LangGraph workflow. The use of conditional edges to handle tool calls and the routing logic are particularly noteworthy. The code is well-commented and easy to follow.  The use of `partial` for the agent nodes improves code readability and maintainability.  The only minor concern is the absence of explicit error handling during graph compilation; a `try-except` block would make it more robust.  The Gemini API calls often return empty responses, however this does not reflect on the quality of the LangGraph implementation itself.  The notebook successfully demonstrates the intended LangGraph workflow.


This notebook implements a LangChain workflow for automated code evaluation using Google Gemini. Let's break down the code and address potential improvements.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Import Statements:** Imports necessary libraries for LangChain, environment variable loading, Google Gemini integration, and LangGraph.

2. **Environment Setup:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`.  This is crucial for securely managing the Gemini API key.

3. **State Definition:** Defines a `TypedDict` called `State` to represent the state of the workflow.  It includes `messages` (a list of messages, annotated with a custom function `add_messages`) and `sender` (the name of the current agent).

4. **LLM and Memory Initialization:** Initializes a `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` LLM using the Gemini model and API key from the environment variables.  `MemorySaver` is used for persisting the conversation history.

5. **Agent Creation Function:**  The `create_agent` function is a helper function to create LangChain agents. It takes an LLM, a system message, and optional tools as input, creating a `ChatPromptTemplate`.  This template dynamically incorporates the messages from the current state.

6. **Agent Node Function:** The `agent_node` function is another helper. It invokes the given agent with the current state and formats the response into an `AIMessage`.

7. **Agent Definitions:** Defines four agents:
    - `class_extractor_agent`: Extracts Java classes from model and submitted solutions.
    - `rubric_extractor_agent`: Extracts rubric details.
    - `initial_eval_agent`: Performs the initial evaluation based on the rubric.
    - `review_eval_agent`: Reviews and potentially updates the evaluation.
    - `extract_marks_agent`: Extracts marks from the evaluation JSON.

8. **Rubric Loading:** Loads the rubric content from a Markdown file (`data/simple-scenario/rubric.md`).  This rubric is then passed to the relevant agents.

9. **`sum_marks` Tool:** Defines a simple tool to calculate the sum of a list of marks.  This tool is integrated into the `total_marks_agent`.

10. **Workflow Router:** The `router` function dictates the flow of execution between agents based on the `sender` in the current state.  It's a state machine implemented using a series of `if/elif` conditions.

11. **Workflow Graph Construction:** Creates a `StateGraph` representing the workflow. Nodes are added for each agent and the `sum_marks` tool. Edges connect the nodes according to the `router` logic. Conditional edges are used to handle tool invocation and routing back to the appropriate agent.

12. **Graph Visualization (Optional):**  The code includes a line to save the graph as a PNG image (`graph.png`).  This is useful for visualizing the workflow.

13. **Graph Streaming Function:** The `stream_graph_updates` function executes the workflow asynchronously, printing updates to the console as they become available.

14. **Workflow Execution:** Reads the model and student solutions from Markdown files, constructs the user input, and executes the `stream_graph_updates` function to run the workflow.


**Potential Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  The LLM calls might fail (e.g., API errors), and the code should gracefully handle these situations.  `try...except` blocks should be added around LLM invocations and tool calls.

* **Input Validation:** Input validation should be added to ensure the model and student solutions are in the expected format.

* **Logging:** Implementing logging would significantly improve debugging and monitoring.

* **Configuration:** The API key and model name are hardcoded.  Consider using configuration files or environment variables more extensively.

* **Modularization:**  The code could be more modular.  Break down the agent creation and node functions into separate modules for better organization.

* **Rubric Format:**  The rubric is loaded from a Markdown file. A more structured format (like JSON) would be more robust and easier to parse.

* **Asynchronous Tool Calls:** The `sum_marks` tool is synchronous. For larger workflows, consider using asynchronous tools to improve performance.


* **Gemini Empty Responses:** The code includes `Gemini produced an empty response. Continuing with empty message` which indicates a problem with the Gemini API calls. This needs to be investigated and fixed.  Check your API key, quota, and network connectivity.  Also, examine the prompts to make sure they are well-formed and clear.


**Example of Error Handling (Illustrative):**

```python
try:
    result = agent.invoke(state)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Agent invocation failed: {e}")

    return {"messages": [], "sender": name}
```
