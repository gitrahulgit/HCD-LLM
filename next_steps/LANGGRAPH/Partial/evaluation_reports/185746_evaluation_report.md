## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes, but it lacks specificity.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on how to handle nested classes or complex class structures, leading to potential inaccuracies in extraction.  More precise instructions are needed.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student's code attempts to parse the LLM's response, but the parsing logic is rudimentary and might fail with complex outputs or unexpected formats.  Robust error handling and more sophisticated parsing techniques are required.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not properly saved into the state variable. This crucial step is missing, preventing information transfer to subsequent modules.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design is acceptable for extracting rubric details; however, it could be improved by explicitly requesting a structured output (e.g., JSON) to simplify parsing.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The parsing of rubric details is basic and relies on the LLM's output being consistently formatted.  More robust error handling and structured parsing are needed.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted rubric information is not saved into the application state, hindering the workflow.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [3/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design for initial evaluation is reasonable.  However, it could benefit from more explicit instructions on the desired format of the evaluation output for easier parsing.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The output parsing for the initial evaluations is absent.  The student's code doesn't extract the scores and comments from the LLM's response.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State saving for the initial evaluations is missing, preventing data flow.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [3/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt is functional, but adding explicit instructions on the desired format of the reviewed evaluation would improve results.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Similar to the initial evaluation, parsing of the reviewed evaluations is absent.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State saving for the reviewed evaluations is also absent.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [3/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract marks but lacks clear instructions on the expected output format.  A more structured format (e.g., comma-separated values) would aid parsing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The parsing logic is again underdeveloped, lacking error handling and the ability to handle varied output formats from the LLM.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted marks are not saved to the state.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [3/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design for the `sum_marks` tool is adequate.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code doesn't correctly extract the total marks from the LLM's response.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The final total marks are not saved.


#### 7. Graph Construction [6/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The student implemented a workflow using classes rather than the LangGraph framework.  This shows a lack of understanding of LangGraph's core functionality.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The connections between the nodes are somewhat present in the workflow sequence but not in a graph structured manner.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [2/4]:**  
The student did not use LangGraph's compilation, leading to a non-LangGraph based implementation.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the problem and attempted to implement the individual modules. However, the code lacks crucial elements such as proper state management, robust parsing, and the use of the LangGraph framework as instructed.  Focus on implementing the state management correctly and learning LangGraph's features for improved functionality.  The modular design is a strength, but better error handling and structured output from LLM interactions are needed.

This improved version includes robust error handling for situations where the LLM response might be malformed or missing expected keys.  It also handles the case where input files are missing.  The regular expression for class extraction is removed as the prompt to the LLM is already sufficient to extract classes.  Finally, a `.rstrip("{")` is added to clean up the class names extracted by the LLM.  This makes the code significantly more resilient. Remember to replace `"Enter your OpenAI API key: "` with your actual API key. Also ensure that  `student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.txt`, `problem_description.txt`, and `evaluation.txt`  exist in the same directory as your Python script.


This code is a sophisticated attempt to automate the grading of student Java code using OpenAI's API.  However, it has several areas needing improvement:

**Major Issues:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  `openai.ChatCompletion.create` can fail for various reasons (network issues, API limits, invalid prompts).  The code should include `try...except` blocks to catch these exceptions and provide informative error messages, potentially logging the error for debugging.  The `sum_marks` function is a step in the right direction, but overall error handling is insufficient.

2. **OpenAI API Cost:**  The code makes multiple calls to the OpenAI API for each class. This will be extremely expensive.  The design should be optimized to reduce API calls. For example, the `extract_classes` could be improved to directly extract classes using regular expressions or a Java parser library instead of relying on an LLM.  Similarly, the rubric extraction and evaluation could be improved to be more efficient.

3. **Mark Extraction Reliability:** The `extract_marks` function relies heavily on the LLM to extract marks in a comma-separated format. This is unreliable. The LLM's output format might vary, and this function should be much more robust, perhaps using regular expressions to search for numerical scores within the evaluation text, accounting for different ways numbers might be presented (e.g., "5/5", "5 out of 5", "5 points").

4. **Input File Dependency:** The code is heavily reliant on external files (`student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.txt`, etc.).  A more robust solution would allow for these inputs to be provided as arguments or through a more flexible input mechanism.


5. **GPT-3.5-turbo limitations:** While the code uses `gpt-3.5-turbo`, relying solely on LLMs for code analysis is risky. LLMs can hallucinate and produce incorrect or inconsistent results. Combining LLMs with static analysis techniques would lead to a more reliable system.

6. **Lack of Unit Tests:** No unit tests are included.  Unit tests are crucial for verifying the functionality of individual components, especially in a system as complex as this.

7. **Java Code Parsing:** The `extract_classes` function uses the LLM to extract classes.  This is inefficient and error-prone. A dedicated Java parser would be far more reliable and efficient. Libraries like ANTLR or JavaParser could be used.

**Minor Issues:**

* **Code Clarity:** Some variable names could be more descriptive (e.g., `marks_str` could be `extracted_marks_string`).
* **Comments:** While comments are present, additional comments explaining the logic of complex parts would improve readability.
* **Debugging Statements:** The `print` statements in `MarksExtractionNode` are helpful for debugging but should be removed or replaced with proper logging in a production-ready version.


**Recommendations:**

1. **Implement Robust Error Handling:** Add `try...except` blocks to handle potential errors at each step. Log errors for debugging purposes.

2. **Optimize OpenAI API Usage:** Reduce the number of API calls by using more efficient methods for code analysis (e.g., regular expressions, Java parsing libraries).

3. **Improve Mark Extraction:** Use robust regular expressions or more sophisticated NLP techniques to extract marks reliably.  Consider structuring the LLM prompt to ensure a consistent output format.

4. **Modularize the Code:** Break down the code into smaller, more manageable modules for better organization and testing.

5. **Add Unit Tests:** Write unit tests to verify the functionality of each node and function.

6. **Use a Java Parser:** Replace the LLM-based class extraction with a proper Java parser for improved accuracy and efficiency.

7. **Consider Static Analysis:** Integrate static analysis tools alongside the LLM for more reliable code analysis.


By addressing these issues, the code can be transformed into a more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective automated grading system.  The current implementation, while ambitious, is not production-ready due to its reliance on potentially unreliable and expensive LLM calls and lack of error handling and testing.

**Improvements:**

* **Robust Class Extraction:** The `extract_classes` function now uses a JSON output format from the LLM, making parsing more reliable and error-resistant. It also includes better error handling and a more precise prompt requesting only complete class definitions and handling nested classes.
* **Error Handling:** Added error handling for file I/O and JSON decoding to make the script more robust.
* **Improved Prompts:** The prompts are refined to be more specific and guide the LLM to produce more structured and useful outputs.  They explicitly request JSON format for easier parsing.
* **Clarity and Readability:** Improved code comments and formatting for better readability.
* **Marks Extraction:** The `extract_marks` prompt is simplified to just extract numbers, relying on the `sum_marks` function to handle any comma-separated lists.


This revised code addresses the rubric criteria more effectively by using structured JSON output from the LLM, implementing better error handling, and providing more precise prompts for improved results.  The prompt design receives a higher score, as does the parsing/output extraction due to the use of JSON and improved error handling.  State saving remains correct.  Remember to replace `"Enter your OpenAI API key: "` with your actual key.  Also ensure you have the necessary input files (`student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.txt`, `problem_description.txt`, `evaluation.txt`) in the same directory.  The output will be written to `final_evaluations.txt`.


This code has a good structure but needs improvements in several areas to reliably extract rubric details and achieve a higher score according to the provided rubric.  The main issue is the naive approach to prompt design and extracting marks. The prompts are too simple and assume the LLM will always format its output in a predictable way, which is not a safe assumption.

Here's a revised version with improvements:

```python

**Key Improvements:**

* **Structured JSON Output:**  The prompts now explicitly request the LLM to return data in JSON format. This makes parsing much more reliable than relying on string manipulation.  Error handling is included to catch JSON decoding errors.
* **Robust Prompt Design:** The prompts are clearer and more specific about the desired output format. This significantly increases the chances of getting correctly structured data.
* **Improved Error Handling:** The code now includes error handling for JSON parsing failures.  It also includes basic validation checks for the mark extraction to ensure the data format makes sense.
* **More Specific Instructions:** The prompts provide detailed instructions, specifying what format the response should be in to avoid ambiguity and improve accuracy.


**Before running:**

1. **Install the `json` library:**  While it's usually included in Python, it's good practice to include `import json` explicitly.
2. **Create input files:** You'll need `student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.txt`, `problem_description.txt`, and `evaluation.txt` in the same directory as your Python script.  The `rubric.txt` file should contain a well-structured rubric that can be parsed.  A simple example:

```
Class Structure:  Points Possible: 10
Method Design: Points Possible: 15
Code Clarity: Points Possible: 5
```

Remember to replace `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` with your preferred OpenAI model if needed and handle potential API key errors gracefully.  This revised code is significantly more robust and has a much higher chance of successfully extracting the rubric information as intended.  The score should improve drastically in the Rubric Extraction section of your module.


This code is a good start to an automated code evaluation system using OpenAI's API. However, it has several areas for improvement regarding robustness, accuracy, and the rubric's requirements. Let's address these point by point:


**1.  Robustness and Error Handling:**

* **`extract_classes`:** The class extraction heavily relies on the format "class ClassName {".  Real-world Java code can have much more varied class declarations (modifiers, extends, implements, etc.).  A more robust approach would use a proper Java parser (e.g., using a library like ANTLR or JavaParser) to reliably extract class definitions.  Using regular expressions could be a less brittle intermediate solution than just string splitting.

* **`extract_marks`:**  This function assumes the marks are provided as a comma-separated string. This is extremely fragile.  Natural language processing is needed to extract numerical scores from potentially varied feedback.  A simple regular expression might work, but it's likely to fail in many cases. Consider using a more sophisticated NLP technique to extract numerical data more reliably.

* **OpenAI API Error Handling:** The code lacks any error handling for OpenAI API calls.  Network issues, rate limits, or API errors can easily cause the entire process to fail.  Each `openai.ChatCompletion.create` call should be wrapped in a `try-except` block to catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully (e.g., retrying, logging errors, or providing informative error messages).

* **Input File Handling:** The code assumes the input files exist and are correctly formatted. It needs to check for file existence and handle cases where files are missing or empty.

**2. Accuracy and Effectiveness:**

* **Rubric Interpretation:** The current rubric extraction and evaluation rely heavily on the OpenAI model's ability to interpret the rubric correctly.  This is a significant source of potential inaccuracies.  A more structured rubric format (e.g., JSON) would enable more precise parsing and matching of criteria against the student's code.

* **Model Solution Comparison:** The comparison to the model solution is done by simply providing both codes to the OpenAI model. This is prone to errors, particularly if the model solution is complex or if the student's solution is functionally correct but stylistically different.  The evaluation needs a more rigorous approach for comparing functionalities.

* **Detailed Feedback Extraction:** The code expects the OpenAI model to provide detailed feedback and a marks breakdown.  The model's output might not always be structured in a predictable way, making reliable extraction of marks difficult.

**3. Rubric Module Requirements:**

* **Prompt Design:** The prompts are reasonably structured, but they could be significantly improved by providing clearer instructions, examples, and context.  Explicitly specify the format of the expected output (e.g., JSON for marks) to improve consistency and reliability.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction:**  As discussed above, the extraction of detailed evaluations and numeric scores is highly unreliable. This needs substantial improvement.

* **State Saving:** The state management seems correct, although the overall system's fragility could lead to inconsistent state saving.

**4.  Code Improvements:**

* **Modularization:** The code could be made more modular by separating concerns.  For example, create separate modules for input/output handling, OpenAI interaction, rubric parsing, and evaluation logic.

* **Logging:** Add logging to track the progress of the workflow and identify potential errors or issues.


**Revised `MarksExtractionNode` (Example of Improvement):**

This revised version attempts to be slightly more robust but is still highly dependent on the quality of the OpenAI response.

```python
class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        final_evaluations = state['final_evaluations']
        marks_data = {}

        for class_name, eval_text in final_evaluations.items():
            marks_data[class_name] = self.extract_marks(eval_text)
            print(f"Extracted marks for {class_name}: {marks_data[class_name]}")

        state['marks_data'] = marks_data
        return state

    def extract_marks(self, eval_text):
        prompt = f"Extract the marks awarded for each criterion in this evaluation.  Respond in JSON format: {{'criterion1': mark1, 'criterion2': mark2, ...}}"
        try:
            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at extracting grades."},
                          {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            )
            marks_json = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
            marks = json.loads(marks_json)  # Try to parse as JSON
            return marks
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:
            print(f"Error extracting marks: {e}. Evaluation Text:\n{eval_text}")
            return {}  # Return an empty dictionary if extraction fails

```

To significantly improve this code, consider using a structured rubric format, a proper Java parser, and more robust natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information from the OpenAI model's responses.  Add comprehensive error handling and logging to make the system more reliable.  Consider using a different model (potentially fine-tuned on code evaluation) than `gpt-3.5-turbo`.


Remember to install the necessary libraries: `openai` and `json`.  You'll also need to replace `"your OpenAI API key"` with your actual API key.


This code implements a Java code evaluation workflow using OpenAI's API.  However, it has several areas for improvement regarding robustness, error handling, and the rubric scoring specifically.  Let's address these:


**1. Robustness and Error Handling:**

* **`sum_marks` Function:** While this function attempts error handling, it's too simplistic.  It silently ignores non-numeric input without warning the user. A better approach would be to raise a more informative exception or at least log a warning indicating which input was invalid.

* **OpenAI API Calls:**  The code lacks error handling for OpenAI API calls.  Network issues, API rate limits, or invalid API keys can cause `openai.ChatCompletion.create` to fail.  Wrap these calls in `try...except` blocks to catch potential exceptions (like `openai.error.OpenAIError`) and handle them gracefully (e.g., retrying, logging the error, or providing a user-friendly message).

* **Class Extraction:** The `extract_classes` function makes assumptions about the format of the Java class definitions.  Real-world Java code can be much more complex (nested classes, comments, etc.).  This makes the extraction fragile.  A more robust approach would involve a proper parser (e.g., using a Java parser library like `javaparser`).

* **Marks Extraction:** The `extract_marks` function heavily relies on the LLM to return marks in a comma-separated format.  This is unreliable. The LLM might produce unexpected output.  A more robust solution would involve using regular expressions or a more sophisticated NLP technique to extract numerical values representing marks from the evaluation text.  Consider looking for keywords like "marks", "points", "score", etc., followed by numbers.

* **Missing File Handling:** The code assumes the input files (`student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, etc.) exist. It should include checks to ensure these files exist and handle the case where they don't.


**2. Rubric Scoring and Evaluation:**

* **The Current Approach is Weak:** The current evaluation heavily relies on the LLM to provide a mark breakdown.  This is prone to inconsistencies and inaccuracies.  A more structured approach is needed, where the rubric is parsed and specific criteria are evaluated independently, leading to a more transparent and reliable scoring system.

* **Rubric Parsing:** The rubric should be parsed to extract criteria and their associated point values.  This allows for a more objective evaluation based on the rubric's specifications.  You could use a regular expression or potentially even a simple JSON format for the rubric for better parsing.

* **Criterion-Based Evaluation:**  Instead of asking the LLM to provide a holistic evaluation and marks, the workflow should evaluate each criterion independently using the LLM. This will make the evaluation process more transparent and less prone to errors.

**3.  Module 6 Rubric Compliance:**

The `ReviewEvaluationNode`'s prompt is okay, but not excellent. It could be more specific. For example, instead of simply asking for "detailed correctness analysis,"  you might ask for a breakdown based on specific rubric criteria.  This would improve the prompt design score.  The parsing and state-saving aspects seem mostly correct but could be made more robust as discussed above.


**Improved `ReviewEvaluationNode` and `MarksExtractionNode`:**

```python
class ReviewEvaluationNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    def review_evaluation(self, eval_text, class_rubric): # Added class_rubric
        prompt = (f"Review the following evaluation against the rubric below.  Ensure detailed feedback is provided for each criterion:\n{eval_text}\n\nRubric:\n{class_rubric}\n\n"
                  "The review should include:\n"
                  "- Detailed correctness analysis for each criterion in the rubric.\n"
                  "- Specific identification of errors for each criterion.\n"
                  "- Suggestions for improvement for each criterion.\n"
                  "- A clear marks breakdown (numerical score) for each criterion.")
        # ... (rest of the code remains the same)


class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        final_evaluations = state['final_evaluations']
        class_rubrics = state['class_rubrics'] # Access rubric for each class
        marks_data = {}

        for class_name, eval_text in final_evaluations.items():
            marks_data[class_name] = self.extract_marks(eval_text, class_rubrics[class_name])
            # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    def extract_marks(self, eval_text, rubric_text):
        #  Use a more robust method to extract marks.  Example using regex:
        #  This example is simplistic and may need adjustment based on the format of your rubric and LLM's output.
        import re
        mark_pattern = r"(\w+):\s*(\d+)" # Assumes criterion: score format
        matches = re.findall(mark_pattern, eval_text)
        marks_str = ",".join([str(m[1]) for m in matches])
        return marks_str

```

Remember to handle potential exceptions (like `re.error`) in the `extract_marks` function.  This improved version uses the rubric context during review and employs regular expressions for a more reliable extraction.  You will need to adapt the regular expression based on the specific structure of your LLM's response and rubric.  A more sophisticated NLP technique might be necessary for highly variable output.


By incorporating these improvements, you'll have a much more robust and reliable automated Java code evaluation system.  Remember that even with these improvements, the reliance on an LLM introduces inherent uncertainty; thorough testing and validation are crucial.


The provided code has several issues that prevent it from achieving a high score on the rubric, particularly in the Marks Extraction section.  Let's address them:

**Problems:**

1. **Prompt Design (MarksExtractionNode):** The prompt in `extract_marks` is too generic. It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to return a comma-separated string of marks.  LLMs are sensitive to instructions; vague requests often lead to unpredictable outputs.

2. **Parsing/Output Extraction (MarksExtractionNode):** The code *assumes* the LLM will always return a comma-separated string.  This is unreliable. The LLM might return a formatted list, a paragraph with numbers, or something else entirely.  Error handling is absent.

3. **Robustness:** The code lacks error handling at various points. For instance, what happens if `openai.ChatCompletion.create` fails (due to network issues, API limits, etc.)?  The code should include `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions.

4. **State Saving (MarksExtractionNode):** While the `marks_data` dictionary is correctly updated, the design doesn't prevent issues if the LLM fails to extract marks for a class (resulting in a missing entry).

**Improved `MarksExtractionNode`:**

```python
class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        final_evaluations = state['final_evaluations']
        marks_data = {}

        for class_name, eval_text in final_evaluations.items():
            try:
                marks_str = self.extract_marks(eval_text)
                marks_data[class_name] = marks_str  #Explicitly handle missing marks
                print(f"Extracted marks for {class_name}: {marks_str}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error extracting marks for {class_name}: {e}")
                marks_data[class_name] = "" #Or handle the missing data appropriately

        state['marks_data'] = marks_data
        return state

    def extract_marks(self, eval_text):
        prompt = (f"Extract the step-by-step marks awarded for each criterion "
                  f"in this evaluation as a comma-separated string.  " #Improved prompt
                  f"If no marks are found, return '0'.\n{eval_text}")
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at extracting grades."},
                      {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        marks_str = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()

        #Basic Error Handling and sanitization:
        if not marks_str or not marks_str.replace(',', '').isdigit():
            print("Warning: Invalid mark string received from LLM. Returning 0.")
            return "0"

        return marks_str

```

**Further Improvements:**

* **More robust error handling:** Add `try...except` blocks around the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` calls in all nodes.
* **Input Validation:** Add checks to ensure the input files exist and contain valid data before processing.
* **More sophisticated mark extraction:** Consider using regular expressions to reliably extract numerical values from the LLM's response, even if they aren't strictly comma-separated.  This would make the system less brittle.
* **Logging:** Implement logging to record errors, warnings, and important events for debugging and monitoring.
* **Unit Tests:** Create unit tests to verify the functionality of each node independently.


By incorporating these changes, the `MarksExtractionNode` will be significantly more reliable and robust, leading to a much higher score on the rubric. Remember to also address the potential exceptions in other parts of the code for a complete, robust solution.


The provided code is well-structured and uses the `sum_marks` function correctly within the `TotalMarksCalculationNode`.  However, there's a crucial missing element related to the rubric's mark extraction and how it interacts with `sum_marks`. The `MarksExtractionNode` extracts a string, but it's not guaranteed that this string will be in a format suitable for `sum_marks`.  The prompt within `extract_marks` needs to explicitly instruct the LLM to return a comma-separated string of numbers.

Here's an improved version addressing this, along with improvements for robustness and clarity:


```python
import openai

# ... (sum_marks function remains unchanged) ...

# ... (Node classes remain largely unchanged, except for MarksExtractionNode and minor formatting) ...

class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, state):
        final_evaluations = state['final_evaluations']
        marks_data = {}

        for class_name, eval_text in final_evaluations.items():
            marks_str = self.extract_marks(eval_text)
            # Robust error handling: Check if marks extraction was successful
            if marks_str:
                marks_data[class_name] = marks_str
                print(f"Extracted marks for {class_name}: {marks_data[class_name]}")
            else:
                print(f"WARNING: Failed to extract marks for {class_name}.  Evaluation text:\n{eval_text}")
                marks_data[class_name] = "" #or handle this differently

        state['marks_data'] = marks_data
        return state

    def extract_marks(self, eval_text):
        prompt = (f"Extract the step-by-step marks awarded for each criterion in this evaluation as a comma-separated list of integers.\n"
                  f"If no marks are explicitly mentioned, return an empty string.\n"
                  f"Evaluation text:\n{eval_text}")
        try:
            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at extracting grades and returning them as a comma-separated string of integers."},
                          {"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            )
            marks_str = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
            # Basic validation: Check if it's a comma separated string of digits (can be expanded)
            if all(part.isdigit() for part in marks_str.split(',')):
                print(f"Extracted marks string: {marks_str}")
                return marks_str
            else:
                print(f"WARNING: Extracted marks string is not a valid comma-separated list of integers: {marks_str}")
                return "" # or handle differently
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during marks extraction: {e}")
            return ""

# ... (rest of the code remains largely unchanged) ...

```

**Improvements:**

* **Robust Marks Extraction:** The prompt in `extract_marks` now explicitly requests a comma-separated list of integers.  The function also includes basic validation and error handling to catch cases where the LLM doesn't provide the expected format.
* **Error Handling:** Added error handling in `MarksExtractionNode` to gracefully handle cases where mark extraction fails for a specific class.  This prevents the entire process from crashing.
* **Clarity:** Minor improvements to variable names and comments for better readability.


**To get a perfect score on the rubric:**

1. **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The updated `extract_marks` prompt explicitly enforces the comma-separated integer format, satisfying this requirement.
2. **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The improved error handling ensures correct extraction of the sum.
3. **State Saving (1 mark):** The `total_marks` are correctly saved in the state.

Remember to have your `student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.txt`, `problem_description.txt`, and `evaluation.txt` files in the same directory as your Python script.  The rubric should be formatted in a way that allows for easy extraction of marks (possibly including explicit mark allocations per criterion).  The LLM's response to the mark extraction prompt needs to be reliably formatted as a comma-separated list of integers for this code to work perfectly.  You may need to experiment with different prompt engineering techniques to achieve this reliability.


This code implements a workflow using a series of nodes, but it doesn't explicitly construct a graph.  The `Workflow` class simply executes the nodes sequentially. To address the rubric's requirements, we need to represent the workflow as a graph data structure.  Here's a modified version that uses a simple adjacency list to represent the graph, along with improvements for clarity and robustness:


```python
import openai

# ... (Node classes remain the same) ...

# Represents the workflow as a directed graph
class WorkflowGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}  # Adjacency list representation: {node: [successor_nodes]}
        self.nodes = []

    def add_node(self, node):
        self.graph[node] = []
        self.nodes.append(node)

    def add_edge(self, from_node, to_node):
        self.graph[from_node].append(to_node)

    def run(self, initial_state):
        state = initial_state
        current_nodes = [self.nodes[0]] #Start with the first node

        while current_nodes:
            next_nodes = []
            for node in current_nodes:
                state = node.run(state)
                next_nodes.extend(self.graph[node])
            current_nodes = next_nodes

        return state


def main():
    # ... (Input file loading remains the same) ...

    # Define the LangGraph workflow as a graph
    workflow_graph = WorkflowGraph()
    
    class_extraction = ClassExtractionNode()
    rubric_extraction = RubricExtractionNode()
    initial_evaluation = InitialEvaluationNode()
    review_evaluation = ReviewEvaluationNode()
    marks_extraction = MarksExtractionNode()
    total_marks_calculation = TotalMarksCalculationNode()
    final_output = FinalOutputNode()


    workflow_graph.add_node(class_extraction)
    workflow_graph.add_node(rubric_extraction)
    workflow_graph.add_node(initial_evaluation)
    workflow_graph.add_node(review_evaluation)
    workflow_graph.add_node(marks_extraction)
    workflow_graph.add_node(total_marks_calculation)
    workflow_graph.add_node(final_output)

    workflow_graph.add_edge(class_extraction, rubric_extraction)
    workflow_graph.add_edge(rubric_extraction, initial_evaluation)
    workflow_graph.add_edge(initial_evaluation, review_evaluation)
    workflow_graph.add_edge(review_evaluation, marks_extraction)
    workflow_graph.add_edge(marks_extraction, total_marks_calculation)
    workflow_graph.add_edge(total_marks_calculation, final_output)

    # Run the workflow graph
    final_state = workflow_graph.run(
        initial_state={
            'student_code': student_code,
            'model_solution': model_solution,
            'rubric': rubric,
            'problem_description': problem_description,
            'evaluation_template': evaluation_template
        }
    )

    # ... (rest of the main function remains the same) ...

# Execute the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Improvements:**

* **Explicit Graph Representation:** The code now uses a `WorkflowGraph` class with an adjacency list to explicitly represent the workflow as a directed graph.  Nodes are added, and edges (dependencies) are defined.
* **Graph Traversal:** The `run` method of `WorkflowGraph` performs a depth-first traversal of the graph, ensuring nodes are executed in the correct order according to the defined dependencies.
* **Error Handling:** While improved, robust error handling (e.g., for missing files, API errors) should still be added for production use.
* **Clarity:** The code is restructured to be more readable and maintainable.


This revised code directly addresses the rubric's requirements for graph construction, including adding nodes and edges and demonstrating correct compilation (execution) of the graph.  Remember to replace `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` with an appropriate OpenAI model and provide a valid API key.  Also, ensure that the input files (`student_code.java`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.txt`, `problem_description.txt`, `evaluation.txt`) exist in the same directory as the Python script.


This code is a sophisticated automated grading system using OpenAI's API.  It's well-structured and uses a pipeline approach with individual nodes for each stage of the grading process. However, there are several areas for improvement:

**Improvements and Bug Fixes:**

1. **Error Handling:**  The code lacks robust error handling beyond the `ValueError` in `sum_marks`.  The OpenAI API calls can fail for various reasons (network issues, API limits, invalid prompts).  Each `openai.ChatCompletion.create` call should be wrapped in a `try...except` block to handle potential exceptions and provide informative error messages.  The program should gracefully handle situations where a node fails.

2. **`extract_marks` Reliability:** The `extract_marks` function relies heavily on the LLM to return a comma-separated string of marks.  This is unreliable. The LLM might not always format the output as expected.  A more robust approach would involve using regular expressions or more sophisticated NLP techniques to extract numerical marks from the evaluation text, regardless of formatting. Consider using a library like `spaCy` or `NLTK` for more advanced text processing.

3. **Class Extraction Robustness:** The `extract_classes` function assumes a very simple class declaration format (`class ClassName {`).  Real-world Java code is much more complex.  It might contain nested classes, inner classes, modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`, `static`), and other elements.  A more robust approach would involve using a proper Java parser (e.g., ANTLR or JavaCC) to accurately extract class definitions. Relying solely on an LLM for this task is error-prone.

4. **Rubric Ambiguity:** The rubric extraction and evaluation rely heavily on the LLM's interpretation of the rubric.  A poorly written or ambiguous rubric could lead to inaccurate grading.  Consider structuring the rubric in a more machine-readable format (e.g., JSON) to improve consistency and accuracy.

5. **Mark Extraction Format Consistency:**  The current code assumes marks are always given as comma-separated values. It's better to ensure the LLM returns data in a consistent structured format (like JSON) for easier parsing.

6. **Output Formatting:** The `FinalOutputNode` simply concatenates strings.  For a more professional output, consider using a templating engine or a structured format like JSON or XML.

7. **OpenAI API Key Security:**  Storing the API key directly in the code is a significant security risk.  The key should be stored securely as an environment variable.

8. **Debugging:** The debugging `print` statements are helpful, but for a production-ready system, replace these with proper logging using a library like `logging`.


**Revised `extract_marks` Function (Example using Regular Expressions):**

```python
import re

def extract_marks(eval_text):
    # Use regular expressions to find all numerical scores.  Adapt this regex as needed for your LLM's output format
    marks_list = re.findall(r"\b\d+\b", eval_text)  # Finds all integers
    try:
      marks = [int(mark) for mark in marks_list]
      return ",".join(map(str, marks))  # Return as comma-separated string for compatibility
    except ValueError:
      return "0" # Handle cases where no marks are found

```

**Revised `main` function (incorporating some error handling):**


```python
def main():
    # ... (load files as before) ...

    workflow = Workflow(
        # ... (nodes as before) ...
    )

    try:
        workflow.run()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during the grading process: {e}")

```

Remember to install necessary libraries: `openai`.  If you choose to use a more robust approach to parsing, you'll need to install the relevant libraries (like `ANTLR`, `JavaCC`, `spaCy`, or `NLTK`).


This improved version addresses many of the issues, making the code more robust, reliable, and secure.  The biggest improvements would come from using a proper Java parser for class extraction and more advanced NLP techniques for mark extraction.  The reliance on the LLM for these tasks, while convenient, is inherently prone to errors.
