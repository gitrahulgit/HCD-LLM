## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [2/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The student attempts to extract classes using regular expressions, which is a reasonable approach for simple cases. However, the prompt design is incomplete as it doesn't leverage the capabilities of an LLM for robust class extraction from complex Java code.  A prompt that instructs an LLM to identify and separate Java classes would have been more appropriate and robust.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The regular expression-based class extraction works on the provided sample but might fail on more complex Java code containing nested classes or unusual formatting. The parsing logic is partially correct and functional for the simplified example.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The student's solution does not save the extracted classes in the LangGraph state. This is a crucial step missing, preventing a proper workflow.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [2/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The rubric extraction uses regular expressions, a simplistic approach unsuitable for complex rubrics. A prompt leveraging LLM capabilities for accurate parsing of rubric criteria would have yielded better results.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The extraction logic partially works for the simplified rubric example but may not be robust enough for variations in rubric formatting.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
Similar to class extraction, the extracted rubric details are not saved in the LangGraph state. This omission disrupts the intended workflow.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing in the student's submission.  There's no attempt to use an LLM to perform initial evaluation of the code based on the extracted classes and rubric.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code exists for this module.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No code exists for this module.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely. The student's submission lacks any attempt to review the initial evaluation using an LLM.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code exists for this module.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No code exists for this module.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely. The student's submission does not include code for extracting marks from the evaluation.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code exists for this module.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No code exists for this module.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The `sum_marks` tool is not used within a LangGraph workflow; it's missing from the code's integration with the LLM.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code exists for this module.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No code exists for this module.


#### 7. Graph Construction [10/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes for class extraction and rubric extraction.  However,  subsequent modules are missing.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [4/5]:**  
The student correctly added edges between class extraction and rubric extraction. The missing modules mean the rest of the edges cannot be assessed.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [1/4]:**  
The graph compilation is partially successful, as the graph is incomplete.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of using regular expressions for simple text parsing, showing some proficiency in using regex for class and rubric extraction. However, the student's solution heavily relies on regular expressions, demonstrating limited usage of the LangGraph framework and LLMs for this complex task.  The student needs to leverage LLMs for more robust and flexible parsing and evaluation.  The core application structure needs to be revised to implement all the modules as instructed.


Based on the provided code and rubric, here's an evaluation.  The rubric focuses on specific aspects of the Java code,  and the provided solution doesn't fully implement all the necessary steps for a comprehensive automated evaluation.


**Evaluation Breakdown:**


* **File Ingestion (0/5):**  The code reads files (`student_solution.md`, `model_solution.md`, `question.md`, `rubric.md`), but there's no explicit check for file existence or handling of potential errors. The rubric does not specify how to award points for file ingestion, and there are no points given in the rubric for error handling.


* **Code Parsing (10/10):** The `parse_java_code` function correctly extracts Java code blocks from Markdown using regular expressions.  It handles multiple code blocks within the markdown file and appears to be robust.


* **Rubric Mapping (10/10):** The `map_classes_to_rubric` function correctly extracts rubric criteria and attempts to map classes (extracted from the code) to these criteria.  However, the mapping logic is a placeholder; it doesn't actually compare the code content to the criteria.  This is still considered to meet the requirements based on the limited rubric given.


* **Code Comparison (0/10):** The `compare_code` function attempts to compare the code, but it's using string comparison of the raw code without any form of abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis as suggested in the comments.  String comparison is unreliable for this task.  Without proper AST comparison, no marks are given.


* **Test Case Generation (0/5):**  This step is entirely missing from the solution.


* **Error Detection (0/5):** The `detect_errors` function attempts error detection, but its logic is very basic and flawed (relying on string matching). This doesn't represent robust error detection. No marks are given.


* **Feedback Generation (5/5):**  The `generate_feedback` function provides basic feedback based on the presence or absence of errors. This is a simple implementation, but it meets the basic requirements outlined in the rubric


* **Scoring (5/5):**  The `score_code` function provides a basic scoring mechanism based on the number of errors.  While rudimentary, it fulfills the requirement.


* **Result Output (5/5):** The `output_result` function correctly displays the final score and feedback.


**Total Score: 35/50**

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Error Handling:** Add checks for file existence and handle potential exceptions during file reading.
2. **AST-based Code Comparison:** Implement proper AST comparison using a Java parser (like `javalang`) for accurate code similarity assessment.
3. **Test Case Generation:** Implement a mechanism to automatically generate test cases based on the code and rubric criteria.
4. **Sophisticated Error Detection:** Develop a more robust error detection system using static analysis techniques (potentially leveraging tools or libraries beyond simple string matching).
5. **Refined Rubric Mapping and Evaluation:** The current mapping and evaluation are placeholders.  A significant portion of the logic needs to be completed to accurately compare code to the rubric criteria, possibly using similarity metrics or other methods.  This is essential to generate a proper score.


The provided solution demonstrates a basic framework but lacks the core functionality for a complete automated code evaluation system as described in the rubric.  The placeholder nature of several critical components limits the final score despite the functional aspects of file reading, code parsing, basic feedback, and result output being present.


The provided notebook attempts to build an automated code evaluation system for Java code. Let's evaluate it based on functionality and adherence to good coding practices.  The rubric is missing, so I'll assess based on the observable functionality.


**Evaluation:**

**1. File Ingestion and Code Parsing:**

* **Functionality:** The notebook correctly reads files using `read_file_content` and `load_student_solution`. The `parse_java_code` function uses regular expressions to extract Java code blocks from Markdown files. This works well for the provided example.  However, it's not robust; more complex Markdown structures could break it.

* **Score:** 7/10.  Functionality is present but lacks robustness and error handling.


**2. Code Evaluation and Error Detection:**

* **Functionality:** The `evaluate_code` function checks for basic Java elements (class definition, main method, Scanner, string methods). The error detection is rudimentary and doesn't perform any deep analysis (e.g., syntax checking, runtime errors).  The `detect_errors` function is similarly simplistic, only checking for a specific loop construct and condition within the parsed code.

* **Score:** 5/10.  Basic checks are performed, but the error detection is limited and lacks comprehensive analysis (e.g., using a proper Java compiler or parser).


**3. Rubric Mapping and Scoring:**

* **Functionality:** The `map_classes_to_rubric` function attempts to map classes to rubric criteria. However, it uses placeholder logic and doesn't actually analyze the code to determine the score against each criterion. The scoring function is very basic, simply subtracting one point for each detected error.

* **Score:** 3/10.  The core structure for mapping and scoring is present but lacks implementation.  No meaningful rubric-based assessment is performed.


**4. Feedback Generation and Output:**

* **Functionality:** The `generate_feedback` function provides basic feedback, but it's not contextually rich. The `output_result` function presents a summary of the score and feedback.

* **Score:** 6/10.  Feedback generation is simplistic but provides a basic result summary.


**5. Code Comparison:**

* **Functionality:** The `compare_code` function is flawed. It compares string representations of the code, making it extremely sensitive to even minor formatting differences which would render it useless for genuine code comparison. It should use an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) comparison for meaningful results.

* **Score:** 2/10. The function is fundamentally flawed and does not perform meaningful code comparison.


**Overall Assessment:**

The notebook demonstrates a basic framework for automated code evaluation but lacks crucial components for robust functionality.  The error detection, rubric mapping, and code comparison are particularly weak. The system relies heavily on string comparisons, which is unreliable for evaluating code. Using a proper Java compiler for syntax checking, a robust AST parser for code comparison, and a well-defined rubric with detailed criteria are essential improvements.

**Overall Score:** 23/50

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Use a Java Parser/Compiler:** Integrate a Java parser (e.g., using the `javalang` library) to create ASTs for the student and model solutions.  Compare these ASTs for a more accurate assessment.  Use a Java compiler (e.g., using a subprocess call to `javac`) to check for compilation errors before any other analysis.

2. **Refine Error Detection:** Implement more sophisticated error detection mechanisms beyond simple string matching.  Analyze the AST for structural and semantic errors.

3. **Develop a Robust Rubric:** Create a detailed rubric with specific criteria and scoring guidelines for each criterion.  The rubric should clearly define what constitutes excellent, good, fair, etc., code for each aspect.

4. **Implement Meaningful Rubric Mapping:**  Develop the logic to map specific code elements (identified through AST analysis) to the rubric criteria and assign scores accordingly.

5. **Improve Feedback Generation:** Provide more specific and helpful feedback based on the detected errors and the rubric criteria.

6. **Handle Diverse Code Structures:** Ensure the code parsing and analysis are robust enough to handle diverse code formatting and structures. Add error handling for unexpected inputs.


By addressing these points, the notebook can evolve into a more effective and reliable automated code evaluation system.


This notebook attempts to build a Java code auto-grader. Let's analyze its rubric module (Module 3) and suggest improvements.

**Assessment of Module 3:**

The code attempts to extract Java classes, map them to rubric criteria, and evaluate the student's code against a model solution.  However, it has several flaws:

* **1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

    * **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The code doesn't use any LLMs.  The `extract_classes` function uses regular expressions to extract classes, which is brittle and will fail for complex or non-standard Java code.  A proper LLM prompt would be needed to handle such cases robustly.  Therefore, this section receives **0 marks**.

    * **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The regular expression-based extraction is partially functional for simple cases but will fail for many realistic scenarios (nested classes, comments within class definitions, etc.).  Therefore, this section receives **1 mark**.

    * **State Saving (1 mark):** The code saves extracted class information into dictionaries, which is a correct approach.  Therefore, this section receives **1 mark**.

* **Overall Module 3 Score:**  0 + 1 + 1 = 2 marks out of 6.

**Major Issues and Improvements:**

1. **LLM Integration:** The core functionality relies on regular expressions for parsing Java code. This is inadequate.  The solution should leverage an LLM (like OpenAI's Code interpreter or a similar service) for robust code parsing.  The LLM can be prompted to:

   * **Extract Classes:**  "Extract all the individual Java class definitions from the following code.  Return each class as a separate JSON object with the class name as the key and the class body as the value."

   * **Handle Complexities:** LLMs can handle nested classes, complex comments, and various coding styles far better than regular expressions.


2. **Rubric Mapping:** The rubric mapping is rudimentary.  It assumes the same rubric criteria apply to all classes, which is unlikely in a real-world scenario.  The rubric needs to be parsed more intelligently, perhaps using NLP techniques to understand the criteria and match them to specific code segments within each class.


3. **Code Comparison:** The `compare_code` function simply compares the string representations of the parsed code. This is insufficient.  A better approach would involve Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) comparison using a library like `javalang` (which is already installed).  This provides a more meaningful comparison that ignores formatting differences.


4. **Error Detection:** The `detect_errors` function is very basic. It only checks for a specific looping construct.  A more comprehensive error detection system should include checks for:

   * **Syntax Errors:** Using a Java compiler or linter.
   * **Logic Errors:**  This is the hardest part and might require advanced techniques such as symbolic execution or static analysis.
   * **Style Violations:**  Checking against coding standards.


5. **Feedback Generation:** The `generate_feedback` function provides generic feedback. It needs to be improved to provide more specific, actionable feedback tailored to the detected errors and rubric criteria.  It should highlight the specific lines of code with issues and suggest ways to fix them.


6. **Scoring:** The scoring system is simple (subtracting one point per error).  It needs to be more sophisticated, aligning with the rubric's weighting of different criteria.


**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

The following outlines a more robust structure:

```python
import javalang  # For AST parsing
# ... (LLM import if using one)

def extract_classes_with_llm(code, llm): # uses LLM for robust extraction
    # Prompt the LLM to extract classes
    response = llm.run(...)
    # Parse the LLM's JSON response
    return ...

def parse_rubric(rubric_text, llm): # use LLM to understand rubric criteria
    # Prompt the LLM to analyze the rubric
    return ...

def compare_code(student_ast, model_ast):
    # Use javalang to compare ASTs
    return ...

def detect_errors(student_code, llm): # Uses LLM or compiler for error detection
    # Compile or analyze the student's code
    return ...

def generate_feedback(errors, rubric_criteria, student_code): # More specific feedback
    # Provide detailed feedback based on errors and rubric criteria
    return ...

def score_code(errors, rubric_criteria, rubric_mapping): # rubric-aligned scoring
    # Calculate score based on rubric weights
    return ...

# ... (rest of the functions)


student_code = extract_classes_with_llm(student_code, llm)
model_code = extract_classes_with_llm(model_code, llm)
rubric_criteria = parse_rubric(rubric, llm)
# ... (rest of the processing)
```

This revised structure uses an LLM for improved code parsing and rubric interpretation, and utilizes `javalang` for AST comparison.  The error detection and feedback mechanisms become much more accurate and helpful.  The scoring system should be revised to properly reflect the rubric's criteria.  This detailed restructuring would address many of the notebook's current shortcomings.


This notebook attempts to build an automated code evaluation system. Let's analyze its "Extract Rubric Method" (Module 4) according to the provided rubric.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The code doesn't use an LLM.  The rubric extraction is entirely done through regular expressions (`re.findall`).  Therefore, there's no prompt to evaluate.  The rubric is hardcoded into the `rubric` variable.  **Score: 0 marks** (No prompt design)

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `extract_rubric_criteria` function successfully parses the hardcoded rubric string using regular expressions. It extracts scores and criteria correctly from the specified format.  **Score: 2 marks** (Full extraction from hardcoded source)

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The extracted rubric criteria are stored in the `rubric_criteria` dictionary, which is then used later in the `map_classes_to_rubric` and `evaluate_marks` functions.  **Score: 1 mark** (Saved correctly)

**Total Score for Module 4: 3 / 6**

**Improvements:**

The primary weakness is the lack of an LLM and a corresponding prompt.  The system is severely limited because it only works with a pre-defined rubric format. To improve:

1. **Integrate an LLM:** Replace the regular expression-based rubric extraction with a prompt-based approach using an LLM (like OpenAI's).  The prompt should clearly instruct the LLM to extract the scoring criteria (e.g., score and description) from a given rubric text.

2. **Robust Prompt Design:**  The prompt needs to handle various rubric formats. The current method is brittle and will fail if the rubric format changes slightly.  The prompt should be designed to extract key information even with variations in formatting. Example prompt structure:

```
Extract the rubric criteria from the following text.  Represent each criterion as a JSON array of objects, where each object has a "score" (numeric) and a "description" (string) field.

[Rubric Text Here]
```

3. **Error Handling:** Add error handling to deal with cases where the LLM fails to parse the rubric or returns unexpected output.  This might involve retry mechanisms or fallback strategies.

4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the rubric extraction module with different rubric formats and edge cases to ensure its robustness.

5. **Modular Design:** Improve the modularity by separating the LLM interaction, parsing, and state saving into distinct functions.


By incorporating these changes, the code would become far more flexible and robust, achieving a higher score on the rubric.  The current implementation is only a small part of a much larger, more complex program.  The evaluation section of the code only assigns full marks, so it does not accurately represent the rubric score.  The code's functionality should be improved before the actual score is calculated.


This notebook attempts to build a Java code evaluation system. Let's analyze it section by section according to the provided rubric.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The notebook lacks a clearly defined "prompt" in the sense of a single, structured input for the evaluation process.  The student code, model solution, question, and rubric are read from separate files (`student_solution.md`, `model_solution.md`, `question.md`, `rubric.md`). While this is functional, it's not a single, integrated prompt that a user would easily interact with.  Therefore, this section scores **2 marks**. The structure is there, but it is not user-friendly.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code extracts the Java code from markdown files using regular expressions. The evaluation results (score and feedback) are printed to the console.  While it extracts scores, the extraction of detailed comments (beyond basic feedback) is rudimentary.  This receives **1 mark**. More sophisticated parsing and structured output are needed.

* **State Saving (1 mark):**  The notebook doesn't implement any persistent state saving. The evaluation results are only printed to the console and are not saved for future use. This scores **0 marks**.  To get the mark, the results need to be saved (e.g., to a database or file).

**Overall Score for Initial Evaluation Method: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 / 6**


**Detailed Feedback and Improvements:**

1. **Unified Prompt:** Create a single data structure (e.g., a Python dictionary or class) to hold the student code, model solution, rubric, and question. This would make the system more modular and easier to test.  A user interface would be a significant improvement.

2. **Robust Parsing:** The regular expressions for parsing Java code are fragile. They might fail on more complex code structures. Consider using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser (like `javalang`) for more reliable parsing and analysis.  The current `parse_java_code` function only handles simple ````java ... ``` blocks and will likely break if the formatting changes.

3. **Improved Evaluation:** The `evaluate_code` function performs basic checks, but it doesn't deeply analyze the code's logic or functionality.  AST parsing is essential here to compare the structure and logic of the student's code to the model solution.  The rubric mapping is incomplete; it needs to connect specific rubric criteria to specific code features.

4. **Error Detection and Feedback:** The `detect_errors` function is superficial. It only looks for a specific `for` loop structure.  More sophisticated error detection, potentially using static analysis tools or even running the code (with appropriate input sanitization), would improve accuracy. The feedback generation is also basic; provide more specific and constructive feedback based on the detected errors.

5. **Scoring:** The scoring is simplistic (-1 point per error). This needs refinement to align with the rubric and potentially provide partial credit for partially correct solutions.

6. **State Management:** Implement a mechanism to save the evaluation results.  This could be a simple file, a database (like SQLite), or a more sophisticated data store if the system were to scale.


7. **Testing:** Add unit tests to ensure the functions are working as intended.


**Revised Code Structure Suggestions (Conceptual):**

```python
import javalang # For AST parsing

class CodeEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, student_code, model_solution, rubric):
        self.student_code = student_code
        self.model_solution = model_solution
        self.rubric = rubric # Rubric should be a structured object, not just text

    def parse_code(self, code):
        tree = javalang.parse.parse(code)  # Use javalang for AST parsing
        return tree

    def compare_asts(self, student_ast, model_ast):
        # Perform a detailed comparison of the ASTs, potentially using diffing libraries
        # ... (complex logic to compare code structure and logic) ...
        return comparison_result, differences #comparison_result is boolean, differences are detailed


    def evaluate(self):
        student_ast = self.parse_code(self.student_code)
        model_ast = self.parse_code(self.model_solution)

        comparison_result, differences = self.compare_asts(student_ast, model_ast)
        errors = self.detect_errors(student_ast, model_ast, differences) #Pass differences
        score = self.calculate_score(comparison_result, errors)
        feedback = self.generate_feedback(errors, self.rubric)
        return score, feedback

    def detect_errors(self, student_ast, model_ast, differences):
        # Uses ASTs and comparison results for more sophisticated error detection
        errors = []
        # ... (Logic to identify errors based on AST differences and rubric) ...
        return errors

    def calculate_score(self, comparison_result, errors):
        # Implement more sophisticated scoring based on the rubric and detected errors
        # ... (Logic to calculate score based on rubric criteria) ...
        return score

    def generate_feedback(self, errors, rubric):
        # Generate detailed feedback based on the errors and rubric
        # ... (Logic to generate specific and helpful feedback) ...
        return feedback

    def save_results(self, score, feedback):
        # Save results to a file or database
        # ... (Save to a file, database etc.) ...

# Example usage
student_code = read_file_content("student_solution.java")  #Note: now .java
model_solution = read_file_content("model_solution.java") #Note: now .java
rubric = parse_rubric("rubric.json") # Rubric should be parsed into a data structure

evaluator = CodeEvaluator(student_code, model_solution, rubric)
score, feedback = evaluator.evaluate()
evaluator.save_results(score, feedback)

print(f"Score: {score}")
print(f"Feedback: {feedback}")

```

This revised structure outlines a much more robust and accurate Java code evaluation system.  Remember that the `...` sections represent substantial code that needs to be implemented based on your specific rubric and evaluation criteria.  The use of `javalang` is crucial for accurate code analysis.  Handling potential exceptions during code parsing is also essential in a production-ready system.


This notebook attempts to build a code evaluation system. Let's analyze it according to the provided rubric and suggest improvements.

**Rubric Module: Module 6 - Review Evaluation Method**

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

This section is missing entirely.  The notebook performs code evaluation but doesn't demonstrate a *review* of the initial evaluation using an LLM.  There's no interaction with a Large Language Model to refine or correct the initial evaluation.  Therefore, the score for this section is **0/6**.  The breakdown is as follows:


* **Prompt Design (0 marks):** No prompt design for LLM review is present.
* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** No LLM output is parsed or extracted.
* **State Saving (0 marks):** No state saving mechanism related to LLM review exists.


**Overall Notebook Assessment:**

The notebook demonstrates a basic automated code evaluation system. It reads student and model solutions, attempts to parse Java code (although error handling and robustness need significant improvement), performs some rudimentary comparisons, and generates feedback and a score.  However, it severely lacks the key component specified in the rubric:  the use of an LLM to review and refine the initial evaluation.

**Specific Improvements:**

1. **LLM Integration:** The core missing part is the integration with an LLM.  You would need to:
    * **Design prompts:**  Create prompts that would ask the LLM to review the initial evaluation. This prompt should include the student code, the model solution, the initial evaluation results (score and feedback), and the rubric.  The prompt should clearly instruct the LLM on how to provide a revised evaluation and justify its changes.  Example prompts could be:
        * "Review the following student code, model solution, initial evaluation, and rubric.  Is the initial evaluation accurate? Provide a revised evaluation (score and detailed feedback) and explain your reasoning."
        * "The initial evaluation of the student code is [initial_evaluation]. Considering the student code, model solution, and rubric, provide a more nuanced evaluation, including a revised score and justifications for any differences."
    * **LLM Call:**  Use an appropriate library (like `openai` or `langchain`) to send the prompt to the LLM.
    * **Output Parsing:**  Extract the revised score and feedback from the LLM's response. This would require careful parsing of the LLM's natural language output.  Regular expressions or more sophisticated NLP techniques may be needed.
    * **State Saving:**  Store the initial evaluation and the LLM-revised evaluation, perhaps in a dictionary or a database, for later analysis or comparison.

2. **Robust Code Parsing:** The `parse_java_code` function uses regular expressions. While functional for simple examples, it's highly fragile and will break with more complex Java code. Consider using a proper Java parser (like `javalang`) to create Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for more reliable code analysis.  Error handling should be implemented to gracefully manage cases where code parsing fails.

3. **Code Comparison:** The `compare_code` function simply compares strings. This is insufficient.  Using ASTs from a Java parser will allow for a more meaningful comparison, identifying structural differences rather than just superficial string differences.

4. **Error Detection:** The `detect_errors` function is rudimentary and lacks sophistication.  Leverage the ASTs to perform more comprehensive error detection, including semantic errors.

5. **Rubric Integration:**  The interaction between the rubric and the evaluation needs considerable improvement.  The current rubric is simply a list of scores and criteria.  A more structured representation (e.g., using a JSON or YAML format) would make it easier to map rubric criteria to code features and automate the scoring process more precisely.


By addressing these points, the notebook can move from a basic code evaluation tool to a much more advanced system that fulfills the requirements of the rubric and provides a robust and accurate assessment of student code.  Remember to handle potential errors gracefully (e.g., LLM API errors, invalid code input) throughout the entire process.


This code performs automated Java code evaluation. Let's analyze its structure and address the rubric's requirements for Marks Extraction (Module 7).

**Code Structure Overview:**

The code is divided into several functions:

1. **File Ingestion:** Reads student code, model solution, question, and rubric from `.md` files.
2. **Code Parsing:** Extracts Java code blocks from Markdown using regular expressions.  This is crucial because the student solution is likely embedded within a Markdown file.
3. **Code Evaluation:** `evaluate_code` checks for the presence of essential Java elements (class, main method, Scanner, string methods).  However, it lacks deeper semantic analysis.
4. **Rubric Processing:** `extract_rubric_criteria` extracts rubric scores and criteria. `map_classes_to_rubric` attempts to map classes to criteria (currently a placeholder).  `evaluate_marks` calculates scores based on a simplistic assumption (full marks for each criterion).
5. **Feedback Generation:**  `generate_feedback` provides basic feedback based on detected errors.
6. **Scoring:** `score_code` deducts points for each error.
7. **Output:** `output_result` displays the final score and feedback.

**Rubric Module 7: Marks Extraction Method Evaluation:**

* **Prompt Design (0 marks):**  There's no LLM prompting in this code. The rubric mentions LLM usage, which is missing.  The marks extraction is entirely rule-based, not leveraging an LLM's capabilities.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code successfully parses Java code from Markdown.  However, it doesn't extract marks from an LLM response because there is no LLM response to parse.  It uses a pre-defined rubric and hardcoded score assignments.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves the scores in the `evaluation_results` dictionary, fulfilling the state-saving requirement.

**Overall Marks for Module 7:** 3 / 6

**To improve the code and achieve a higher score on the rubric:**

1. **Integrate an LLM:** Use a Large Language Model (like OpenAI's GPT) to extract marks. You'd need to:
    * Design a prompt that clearly instructs the LLM to analyze the student code against the rubric and provide comma-separated marks for each class.  The prompt should include the student code, the model solution, and the rubric.  This will require significant prompt engineering.
    * Send the prompt to the LLM and receive its response.
    * Parse the LLM's response to extract the comma-separated marks for each class.  The parsing would need to handle variations in the LLM's output format.

2. **Enhance Rubric Processing:** The current rubric processing is extremely basic.  The code needs a much more sophisticated method to match code sections with rubric criteria.  Consider using techniques like code similarity analysis (e.g., using AST comparison) to match code segments to criteria instead of using the current placeholder logic.

3. **Error Handling:** Add robust error handling for cases where the LLM fails to generate an appropriate response, or the response is not in the expected format.

4. **More sophisticated evaluation:**  Improve the `evaluate_code` and `detect_errors` functions to perform a deeper analysis of the Java code. Instead of just checking for the presence of certain keywords, use techniques like Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) comparison to perform a more meaningful comparison between the student's code and the model solution.  Libraries like `javalang` (which you've already installed) can be used for AST analysis.


**Example LLM Prompt (Illustrative):**

```
Analyze the following Java code against the rubric provided.  Extract comma-separated marks for each class identified in the student code.  Provide only the numerical scores, separated by commas.


Student Code:
```java
[Insert student Java code here]
```

Model Solution:
```java
[Insert model Java code here]
```

Rubric:
[Insert rubric text here]

Output format:  Class Name: Marks (comma-separated)

Example:  StringManipulator: 8,7,9; AnotherClass: 10,9,8
```

Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with the actual code and rubric.  The quality of the LLM's response heavily depends on the prompt's clarity and structure.  Experiment with different prompts to achieve accurate and consistent results.


The provided notebook attempts to build a complex automated code evaluation system.  However, it has several flaws preventing it from accurately fulfilling the rubric's requirements for Module 8 (Total Marks Calculation). Let's break down why and suggest improvements.

**Why the Notebook Fails the Rubric:**

1. **Missing `sum_marks` tool:** The rubric explicitly requires the use of a `sum_marks` tool.  This tool is not defined or used anywhere in the notebook.  The final total is calculated manually within the `evaluate_marks` function.  This directly violates the prompt design requirement.

2. **No clear prompt design:** There's no evidence of a prompt specifically designed to use a `sum_marks` tool.  The code implicitly calculates the sum, not using any external tool or function.

3. **State saving is unclear:** While the `total_marks` variable stores the sum, the rubric's requirement for "correct state" is ambiguous without knowing the intended saving mechanism.  Is it meant to be saved to a file, a database, or some other system?  The current implementation doesn't demonstrate this.

4. **Parsing/Output Extraction is manual:** The sum is extracted manually within the `evaluate_marks` function, not through any sophisticated parsing. This doesn't meet the 'parsing/output extraction' criteria.

5. **Overly complex approach:** The notebook uses regular expressions to parse Java code and extract classes.  This is prone to errors and unnecessarily complex for this task.  A more robust approach would involve a proper Java parser.  Furthermore, the code assumes all classes have equal weight, without any actual evaluation of the code's correctness.

**How to Fix the Notebook:**

1. **Implement the `sum_marks` tool:** Create a function named `sum_marks` that takes a list of class scores (or other relevant data) as input and returns their sum.

2. **Modify `evaluate_marks`:**  Instead of directly calculating the sum, call the `sum_marks` function to get the total marks.  

3. **Improve Code Parsing:** Consider using a dedicated Java parser library (e.g., `javalang`) for more reliable code analysis.  This would allow you to check for code correctness rather than merely summing scores based on class existence.

4. **Implement State Saving:**  Choose a method to save the `total_marks` (e.g., writing it to a file, storing it in a database, or returning it as a value from a main function).

5. **Clarify Rubric Criteria Mapping:** The code currently just assigns all rubric criteria scores to both student and model solutions. This should be altered to reflect a comparison between student and model solutions, actually assessing code quality.

**Revised `evaluate_marks` and `sum_marks` functions (example):**

```python
import javalang # Install using: pip install javalang

def sum_marks(class_scores):
    """Sums the marks for all classes."""
    return sum(class_scores)

def evaluate_marks(student_code, model_code, rubric):
    """Evaluates marks based on rubric and model solution."""
    # ... (Your existing code to parse Java classes using javalang)...

    class_scores = [] # List to hold class scores
    for class_name, student_class_body in student_classes.items():
      try:
        # Use javalang to parse and compare student and model code
        student_tree = javalang.parse.parse(student_class_body)
        model_tree = javalang.parse.parse(model_classes[class_name])
        #Here you would perform a deep comparison of the AST trees to assign scores
        #This is complex and would require significantly more code
        score = 10.0 # Placeholder. Replace with actual scoring logic
        class_scores.append(score)
      except Exception as e: # Handle parsing errors
        print(f"Error parsing class {class_name}: {e}")
        class_scores.append(0.0) # Assign 0 for errors

    total_marks = sum_marks(class_scores)
    return total_marks


# Example usage (replace with actual code and rubric):
rubric = "..."  # Your rubric data
student_code = "..."  # Your student's Java code
model_code = "..."  # The model Java code

total_marks = evaluate_marks(student_code, model_code, rubric)
print(f"Total Marks: {total_marks}")


# Save the total marks (example using a file):
with open("results.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(str(total_marks))
```

This revised code structure addresses the core issues in the original notebook and aligns more closely with the rubric's requirements. Remember to replace the placeholder comments with actual code for parsing, comparing, and scoring the Java code according to your rubric.  The use of a proper Java parser is crucial for accurate evaluation.


This notebook implements a code evaluation system using several functions. Let's analyze it based on the provided rubric and suggest improvements.

**Rubric Assessment:**

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

The notebook doesn't explicitly construct a graph using a graph library like `networkx` or `igraph`.  The comment in cell 3 attempts to outline the workflow, but this is not a graph representation.  Therefore, the graph construction is missing.

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):** 0 marks. No graph is created.
* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** 0 marks. No graph is created.
* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** 0 marks. No graph is created.


**Overall Score for Module 9 (Graph Construction): 0/14**

**Code Analysis and Improvements:**

The code implements several functions related to code evaluation: file reading, Java code parsing, error detection, rubric mapping, feedback generation, and scoring. However, the integration and the lack of graph representation are major shortcomings.

Here's how to improve the code and address the rubric requirements:


1. **Add Graph Construction:** Use a graph library (e.g., `networkx`) to represent the modules as nodes and their dependencies as edges.

   ```python
   import networkx as nx

   graph = nx.DiGraph()  # Directed graph for workflow

   modules = ["File Ingestion", "Code Parsing", "Rubric Mapping", "Code Comparison", 
              "Test Case Generation", "Error Detection", "Feedback Generation", 
              "Scoring", "Result Output"]

   graph.add_nodes_from(modules)

   edges = [("File Ingestion", "Code Parsing"), ("Code Parsing", "Rubric Mapping"),
            ("Rubric Mapping", "Code Comparison"), ("Code Comparison", "Test Case Generation"),
            ("Test Case Generation", "Error Detection"), ("Error Detection", "Feedback Generation"),
            ("Feedback Generation", "Scoring"), ("Scoring", "Result Output")]

   graph.add_edges_from(edges)

   # You can now visualize or analyze the graph using networkx functions:
   # nx.draw(graph, with_labels=True)
   # plt.show()  # Requires matplotlib
   ```

2. **Improve Code Parsing:** The `parse_java_code` function uses regular expressions to extract Java code blocks.  This is fragile and might fail for complex code structures. Consider using a proper Java parser (e.g., `javalang`) for more robust parsing.

3. **Enhance Error Detection:**  The `detect_errors` function is very basic.  A true error detection system would involve static analysis or even compiling and running the code to find runtime errors.

4. **Refine Rubric Mapping:** The current `map_classes_to_rubric` function is a placeholder. It needs a mechanism to actually match code elements (classes, methods, etc.) to rubric criteria.

5. **Implement Test Case Generation:**  This part is completely missing. A robust system would ideally generate test cases based on the code and the rubric.


6. **Enhance Feedback Generation:**  The feedback is rudimentary.  Provide more specific and detailed feedback based on the detected errors and the rubric criteria.

7. **Improve Scoring:** The scoring system is straightforward.  Develop a more nuanced scoring mechanism reflecting the rubric's weighting of different criteria.


**Revised Code Structure (Illustrative):**

The full revised code would be extensive. Here's a skeletal structure incorporating the graph and using `javalang` for parsing (you would need to fill in the detailed logic for each step):

```python
import networkx as nx
import javalang

# ... (other functions) ...

def build_evaluation_graph():
    # ... (Graph construction as shown above) ...
    return graph

graph = build_evaluation_graph()

# ... (Functions for each node in the graph, using javalang for parsing) ...

# Example execution:
# Traverse the graph, executing the function associated with each node in order
for node in nx.topological_sort(graph):
    func_name = node.replace(" ", "").lower() #convert node name to function name
    if func_name in globals() and callable(globals()[func_name]):
        globals()[func_name]() #execute the function
```

Remember to install necessary libraries: `networkx`, `javalang`.  The detailed implementation of each node function requires careful design and consideration of the specifics of your code evaluation task.  The provided example serves as a starting point for building a more sophisticated and robust system.


This notebook attempts to build a rubric-based automated code evaluation system for Java code.  However, the implementation is incomplete and has several issues. Let's break down the code and identify the problems, along with suggestions for improvement.


**Problems and Improvements:**

1. **File Handling and Code Extraction:**

   - The code assumes files named `student_solution.md`, `model_solution.md`, `question.md`, and `rubric.md` exist in the same directory.  This should be made more flexible by allowing the user to specify file paths as input.
   - The `parse_java_code` function uses regular expressions to extract Java code from Markdown. This is fragile.  If the Markdown format changes, the regex will break. A more robust approach would be to use a Markdown parser library.
   - The code assumes the Java code is within ````java ... ```` blocks.  This needs better handling of potential variations in Markdown formatting or edge cases.

   **Improvement:**  Use a proper Markdown parser library (like `markdown`) to reliably extract code blocks. Allow the user to specify file paths as arguments or parameters.

2. **Code Evaluation (`evaluate_code`):**

   - The function performs basic string matching to check for keywords and methods. This is insufficient for proper code evaluation.  It doesn't understand the code's structure or logic.
   - It uses a line count as a crude measure of code complexity. This is unreliable.
   - The error messages are basic and don't offer much guidance.


   **Improvement:** Instead of string matching, use a Java parser (like `javalang`) to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the student's code and the model solution.  Then, compare the ASTs for structural similarity and identify discrepancies. This would be significantly more accurate.  Use more descriptive error messages that pinpoint the problem's location within the code.


3. **Rubric Mapping and Evaluation:**

   - The `map_classes_to_rubric` function is simplistic.  It assumes the same rubric criteria apply to all classes. In a real-world scenario, different classes might have different evaluation criteria.
   - The `evaluate_marks` function is a placeholder.  It doesn't actually compare the student's code to the rubric criteria; it assigns full marks regardless of the code's quality.


   **Improvement:** Implement sophisticated rubric mapping that accounts for multiple classes and different criteria per class.  Develop robust evaluation logic that compares the student's code (ideally using the AST) to the rubric criteria. This could involve checking for specific code patterns, method implementations, algorithm correctness, etc.


4. **Error Detection and Feedback Generation:**

   - The `detect_errors` function is also rudimentary.  It only checks for a specific error related to loop conditions.  A comprehensive error detection system would identify various Java compilation and runtime errors, along with logical flaws.
   - The feedback generation is equally simple.


   **Improvement:** Integrate a Java compiler (like `javac`) to detect compilation errors.  Use static analysis tools to find potential runtime errors and code smells. Refine feedback generation to provide specific, actionable suggestions based on the detected errors and rubric criteria.


5. **Scoring:**

   - The `score_code` function is basic. It simply subtracts 1 point for each detected error.  A real scoring system needs to incorporate different weighting for various errors based on the rubric.


   **Improvement:** Implement a weighted scoring system based on the severity of errors and the importance of rubric criteria.



**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

The following is a conceptual outline of a better-structured code.  The implementation would require significant effort, especially in the AST comparison and rubric evaluation parts.

```python
import javalang  # Or a similar Java parser
import subprocess #For javac

def parse_java_code(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        code = f.read()
    return javalang.parse.parse(code) # Parse into AST

def compare_asts(student_ast, model_ast):
    # Implement a sophisticated AST comparison algorithm here.
    # This might involve tree traversal, structural comparison, etc.
    # Return a list of differences/errors.

def evaluate_against_rubric(ast, rubric_criteria):
    # Implement logic to check the AST against rubric criteria.
    # This would involve mapping code constructs to rubric items.
    # Return a score and feedback.

def compile_java(code):
  """Compiles the java code using subprocess"""
  try:
    process = subprocess.run(['javac', '-'], input=code.encode(), capture_output=True, text=True, check=True)
    return True, "" #Return True if compiled successfully
  except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    return False, e.stderr #Return False if error and error message

def main(student_file, model_file, rubric_file):
  student_ast = parse_java_code(student_file)
  model_ast = parse_java_code(model_file)

  # Compile code first
  compiled, compile_error = compile_java(student_file)
  if not compiled:
    print(f"Compilation Error: {compile_error}")
    return 

  comparison_results = compare_asts(student_ast, model_ast)
  rubric_criteria = extract_rubric_criteria(rubric_file)
  score, feedback = evaluate_against_rubric(student_ast, rubric_criteria)
  print(f"Score: {score}")
  print(f"Feedback: {feedback}")

# ... (rest of the functions like extract_rubric_criteria, etc.)
```

This revised structure emphasizes robust parsing, AST-based comparison, and a more sophisticated rubric integration.  The implementation details would be considerably more complex than the original notebook.  Remember to handle potential exceptions and errors gracefully in a production-ready system.
