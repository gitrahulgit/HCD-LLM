## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks precision.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on how to format the output (e.g., JSON, key-value pairs) making parsing more difficult.  The prompt should specify the desired output format for easier processing.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student's code includes a `parse_extracted_classes` function, demonstrating an attempt at parsing. However, this function is not robust enough to handle various LLM output formats and might fail if the LLM's response is not perfectly structured. The function needs improvements in handling variations in the LLM's response.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted classes are correctly saved into the `EvaluationState` dictionary.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely.  No code is provided for extracting rubric details. A prompt should be designed to extract relevant rubric sections for each class.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing is performed as the module is missing.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is performed as the module is missing.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.  No prompt is provided for evaluating class code. A well-structured prompt is needed, incorporating student code, relevant rubric details, and the model solution.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing is done as the module is missing.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is performed because the module is absent.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. A prompt is needed to instruct the LLM to review and refine the initial evaluation.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing is performed because the module is absent.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is done as the module is missing.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. A prompt should be created to specifically extract numerical marks from the LLM's evaluation.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing is done because the module is missing.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is done since the module is absent.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. A prompt is needed to utilize the `sum_marks` tool effectively.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing is performed because the module is missing.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving occurs as this module is missing.

#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes representing the implemented modules to the LangGraph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
Edges connecting the nodes are correctly defined, representing the workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles and runs without errors.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a good understanding of LangGraph's graph construction and node addition. However, the core evaluation logic (modules 2-6) is missing. The student needs to focus on designing effective LLM prompts for each evaluation step, implementing robust parsing functions, and ensuring proper data flow between modules using the LangGraph state.  The class extraction module needs improvement in prompt design and error handling.


## Module 1 Grading

Based on the provided rubric and code, here's a breakdown of the grading for Module 1:

**Total Marks Possible: 50**

The rubric states that no marks should be deducted for error handling or type checking, and compilation is assessed separately.  The evaluation focuses solely on the aspects explicitly mentioned in the rubric.  The provided `evaluate_submission` function is a placeholder and does not use the LLM or the graph structure.  Therefore, no marks can be awarded for the LLM invocation, graph construction, or actual evaluation.


**Marks Awarded:**

* **Installation and API Key Setup (5 marks):**  The code correctly installs necessary libraries using `pip` and sets the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable using a secure method (`getpass`).  **5/5**

* **LLM Initialization (5 marks):** The code successfully initializes a `ChatOpenAI` LLM. **5/5**

* **Node Implementations (30 marks):** Each function (`classExtraction`, `rubricExtraction`, `initialEvaluation`, `reviewEvaluation`, `marksExtraction`, `totalMarksCalculation`) correctly defines a node in the LangGraph. The functions correctly construct the prompt for the LLM.  The code structure follows the model solutionâ€™s way of invoking the LLM and saving outputs. **30/30**

* **Graph Building (10 marks):** The code constructs the LangGraph using `StateGraph`, adding nodes and edges as specified. The conditional edge based on the `should_recheck_classes` function is also correctly implemented. The `display(Image(...))` line shows a visualization of the graph created.  **10/10**


**Total Marks Awarded: 50/50**

**Detailed Comments:**

* The solution perfectly adheres to the specified structure for creating LangChain nodes and building the graph.
* The prompt engineering within each function seems well-designed.
* The `evaluate_submission` function is a crucial missing component, needing the actual integration of the LLM responses and rubric application.  The current placeholder function simply performs basic string checks and does not reflect an actual automated evaluation.
* The test case provided is incomplete as the execution of the graph and subsequent mark extraction are commented out. It is not possible to evaluate the correctness of this part without actually running the whole pipeline.


**To improve the solution:**

1. **Implement the `evaluate_submission` function:**  This function should utilize the LLM outputs generated by the LangGraph to perform a more complete evaluation, adhering to the rubric. This would involve processing the LLM's response (likely containing extracted classes and rubric assessment) to calculate the final marks.

2. **Uncomment and run the evaluation pipeline:** The code in the final code cell should be uncommented and executed to test the complete system and receive actual marks from the LLM.


Without the implementation of a fully functioning evaluation based on the LLM responses and rubric, the practical functionality of the assignment cannot be assessed, despite the perfect adherence to the structural requirements described in the rubric.


### RUBRIC MODULE: Module 2 - Evaluation

**Student's Submission Evaluation:**

The student's submission demonstrates a functional automated assessment pipeline using Langchain and Langgraph.  However, several areas require improvement.

**1. Install Libraries and Set OpenAI API Key (5 points):**

* **Score:** 5/5
* **Feedback:** The code correctly installs necessary libraries and securely prompts for the OpenAI API key.


**2. Initialize LLM (5 points):**

* **Score:** 5/5
* **Feedback:** The LLM is correctly initialized using `ChatOpenAI` with a specified model and temperature.


**3. Class Extraction Node (15 points):**

* **Score:** 10/15
* **Feedback:** The `classExtraction` function attempts to extract Java classes.  However, it makes assumptions about the message order (student code as the first message, model solution as the second) which is brittle and unreliable. The function should robustly handle various message structures.  The prompt itself is too simplistic and may not be sufficient for complex Java code.  The function needs to include more sophisticated prompts and error handling for cases where no classes are found or the code is invalid.


**4. Rubric Extraction Node (15 points):**

* **Score:** 5/15
* **Feedback:** The `rubricExtraction` function is too simplistic. It directly passes the rubric to the LLM without any pre-processing or context, making the extraction less effective. It relies on the LLM to understand the context and extract the marking scheme, which is prone to errors.   The function should include a more sophisticated prompt that explicitly instructs the LLM on what information to extract from the rubric and how to format the response.


**5. Initial Evaluation Node (15 points):**

* **Score:** 10/15
* **Feedback:** Similar to the rubric extraction, `initialEvaluation` is too simple. It just compares student and model solutions without specifying comparison criteria. A more effective approach would involve structured comparison, potentially using code similarity metrics or a more detailed prompt guiding the LLM. It also lacks error handling.


**6. Review Evaluation Node (15 points):**

* **Score:** 5/15
* **Feedback:** The `reviewEvaluation` node lacks specificity. The prompt is vague.  It needs to explicitly instruct the LLM to use the extracted rubric and the initial comparison to provide a detailed review of the student's submission.  It should clearly define the expected format for the review.


**7. Marks Extraction Node (15 points):**

* **Score:** 5/15
* **Feedback:** The `marksExtraction` function, like others, needs a more precise prompt. The function relies on the preceding nodes to provide sufficient information for accurate mark extraction, which is not guaranteed given the weaknesses in those nodes. It should clearly specify the desired format for the extracted marks (e.g., a JSON object).


**8. Total Marks Calculation Node (10 points):**

* **Score:** 5/10
* **Feedback:**  The `totalMarksCalculation` node relies on the previous node producing correctly formatted individual question marks.  It lacks error handling for cases where the marks are not properly formatted or are missing.  A more robust solution would be to implement a calculation function that handles various input formats and error cases.


**9. Graph Building (10 points):**

* **Score:** 10/10
* **Feedback:** The graph is correctly built using Langgraph, including the conditional edge to recheck classes.  The visualization is helpful.


**10. Invocation and Testing (10 points):**

* **Score:** 0/10
* **Feedback:** The invocation and testing section is incomplete. The provided code for `evaluate_submission` is a rudimentary placeholder and does not use the Langchain/Langgraph pipeline.  It needs to be integrated with the graph execution and the LLM to provide a true end-to-end test. The `evaluate_submission` function lacks robust error handling and only addresses a very limited subset of the rubric's criteria.  A comprehensive test would require multiple examples of student submissions with varying levels of correctness to properly evaluate the system.


**Total Score:** 65/100


**Overall Feedback:**

The project demonstrates a good understanding of the basic concepts of Langchain and Langgraph. The student successfully created a pipeline, but the individual nodes need significant improvements in terms of prompt engineering, error handling, and robustness.  The testing section is crucial and needs to be fully implemented to assess the pipeline's effectiveness.  The evaluation logic is far from complete and only scratches the surface of what's required for accurate grading based on the provided rubric.  A proper implementation should leverage the LLM's capabilities more effectively, utilizing its abilities for nuanced comparison and review. The assumption of specific message ordering in the `classExtraction` function is a significant design flaw.  The student should focus on improving the prompts used in each node and adding robust error handling to make the pipeline more resilient.


This notebook uses Langchain to build a state graph for automated code evaluation. Let's assess it based on the provided rubric.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design receives **2 marks**.  While the prompts are separated for student and model solutions, they're embedded within a larger system message ("Extract all Java classes from the provided code submission."). This larger message could be considered superfluous for the class extraction task itself.  A more focused prompt directly asking for class extraction from the given code would be better.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**  The parsing and output extraction receive **1 mark**. The code relies entirely on the LLM to correctly extract classes. There is no error handling or robust parsing of the LLM's response. If the LLM returns anything unexpected, the code might fail silently or produce incorrect results.  The code assumes the LLM will return classes in a readily usable format, which is a risky assumption.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The state saving receives **1 mark**. The extracted messages (including the presumably extracted classes) are correctly stored in the `state` variable for later nodes in the graph.

**Overall Score for Extract Class Method:** 2 + 1 + 1 = **4 / 6**


**Improvements:**

1. **Refined Prompts:**  The prompts should be more concise and directly focused on class extraction. For example:

   ```
   student_class_extraction_prompt = "Extract all Java class definitions from the following code:\n\n{student_code}"
   model_class_extraction_prompt = "Extract all Java class definitions from the following code:\n\n{model_code}"
   ```

2. **Robust Parsing:** Instead of directly relying on the LLM's output, add code to parse the response.  This could involve regular expressions to identify class declarations (`public class MyClass { ... }`), or even a simpler approach like splitting the response by curly braces and checking for class keywords.

3. **Error Handling:** Implement `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle potential errors from the LLM (e.g., unexpected output format, LLM failures).  Log these errors for debugging.

4. **Output Validation:**  After extraction, it's crucial to validate that the extracted classes are indeed valid Java classes.  This could involve basic syntax checks or even attempting to compile the extracted code (though compilation would require additional setup).


**Example of improved `classExtraction` function:**

```python
import re

def classExtraction(state: MessagesState):
    student_code = state["messages"][0].content
    model_code = state["messages"][1].content

    student_classes = extract_classes(student_code)
    model_classes = extract_classes(model_code)

    state["student_classes"] = student_classes
    state["model_classes"] = model_classes

    return {"messages": state["messages"]} #Return original messages and add classes to state

def extract_classes(code):
    classes = []
    matches = re.findall(r"public\s+class\s+(\w+)\s*{(.*?)}", code, re.DOTALL)
    for match in matches:
        classes.append({"name": match[0], "body": match[1]})
    return classes

```

This improved version uses regular expressions for a basic class extraction, saves to the state, and adds a separate helper function `extract_classes` to improve readability and maintainability.  Remember to add error handling and more sophisticated validation for production use.  The evaluation section also needs significant improvements to accurately reflect the rubric's criteria.  The current evaluation is overly simplistic and doesn't consider many aspects of the rubric.


The provided code implements a Langchain-based automated assessment pipeline. Let's evaluate Module 4 based on the given rubric.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in `rubricExtraction` is:  `SystemMessage(content="You are tasked with extracting the rubric marking scheme for evaluating students' answers based on the model solution.")`  This prompt is insufficient.  It doesn't provide the model solution or any context about the assignment.  A good prompt would include the model solution code, the student's code, and a clear instruction on the expected format of the extracted rubric.  Therefore, I'd rate this as **1 mark**.  The prompt is partially complete, but severely lacks crucial information.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code doesn't actually *parse* the LLM's response. `rubricExtraction` simply returns the LLM's raw output.  No attempt is made to extract specific rubric criteria, marks, or weighting.  This is a significant flaw.  Therefore, I'd rate this as **0 marks**. Extraction fails due to lack of parsing.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The rubric details are appended to the `state["messages"]` list. This is a correct way to save the information for later use within the pipeline.  Therefore, I'd rate this as **1 mark**.

**Total for Extract Rubric Method: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 marks out of 6**


**Overall Feedback:**

The biggest problem is the lack of parsing. The `rubricExtraction` function only sends the prompt to the LLM and returns the raw response without any processing. This means the rubric information is not usable in subsequent stages.  The prompt design is also weak, making it unlikely the LLM would return structured, easily parsable rubric information.

To improve this module:

1. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering:** The prompt needs significant revision. It should:
    * Clearly specify the task: "Extract the rubric criteria, their corresponding points, and the total points possible. Present the rubric in a structured format like JSON or a table."
    * Include both the model solution and the student's code.
    * Provide examples of the desired output format.

2. **Implement Parsing:** Add code after the LLM call to parse the response.  This might involve:
    * Regular expressions to extract key information (if the LLM returns text).
    * JSON parsing (if the LLM returns JSON).
    *  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand the rubric structure if the output is free-form text.

3. **Error Handling:** Include error handling to deal with situations where the LLM fails to return a valid response or the parsing fails.

4. **Testing:** The testing section uses a hardcoded evaluation function instead of actually using the LLM and the parsed rubric for grading. This renders the test useless in assessing the rubric extraction component. The test should utilize the output of the LLM and the parser to determine the marks for each criterion and then calculate the total.


By addressing these points, the `Extract Rubric Method` module can be significantly improved and achieve a much higher score according to the rubric.  The current implementation only demonstrates a basic framework; the core functionality of extracting and parsing the rubric is missing.


This code implements an automated grading system using Langchain and LangGraph. Let's analyze it according to the provided rubric.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt design is *incomplete* (1 mark). While the code provides system messages to guide the LLM, it doesn't explicitly construct a comprehensive prompt that includes all the necessary elements for accurate assessment.  The student code, model solution, and rubric are passed as separate variables to the `evaluate_submission` function, not directly integrated into the LLM prompt within the Langchain nodes. A better design would incorporate all three directly into the prompt sent to the LLM.  The rubric is complex; a more structured way of presenting it (e.g., JSON) would improve the LLM's ability to parse and apply it.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The parsing and output extraction are *incomplete* (1 mark). The `evaluate_submission` function performs a rudimentary check of the student code. A real-world scenario would demand much more sophisticated parsing and comparison logic to accurately assess adherence to the rubric, especially the qualitative aspects. The code doesn't attempt to extract detailed evaluations and numeric scores from the LLM's response; it manually calculates a score.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** State saving is *incorrect* (0 marks). The code uses `MessagesState` but doesn't effectively utilize it to pass the evaluation results to subsequent nodes in the LangGraph. The `should_recheck_classes` function attempts a form of state-based control flow, but the results of the `initialEvaluation` node are not properly integrated.  The final evaluation is written to `final_evaluation.txt` outside the LangChain flow.


**Overall Score for Module 5:**

Based on the analysis above, the overall score for Module 5 would be **2/6**.  The code demonstrates a basic understanding of LangChain and LangGraph, but lacks crucial components for a fully functional automated grading system, particularly in prompt design, thorough evaluation, and robust state management.


**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Improved Prompt Engineering:** Structure the prompt sent to the LLM more carefully.  Use a structured format like JSON to represent the rubric. Include clear instructions on how the LLM should compare the student and model solutions based on specific rubric criteria. Provide example comparisons to help the LLM understand the expectations.

2. **Robust Evaluation Logic:** Replace the simplistic `evaluate_submission` function with a more robust mechanism.  This might involve techniques like:
    * **Code Parsing:** Use a Java parser (e.g., JavaParser) to analyze the Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of the student and model solutions. This allows for precise comparisons of class structures, method signatures, and other code elements.
    * **Diffing:**  Compare the parsed code structures using a diffing algorithm to identify differences.
    * **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Use NLP techniques to analyze the LLM's responses to the evaluation prompts, extracting numerical scores and qualitative feedback.

3. **Effective State Management:**  Ensure that the results from each LangChain node (especially the initial evaluation and review) are properly stored in the `MessagesState` and passed along the LangGraph. This allows subsequent nodes to build upon the previous analysis.  The final score should be calculated and stored within the LangChain/LangGraph workflow.

4. **Error Handling:**  Include error handling to manage situations where the LLM fails to generate a suitable response or the code parsing encounters issues.

5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the system with various student submissions, both correct and incorrect, to validate its accuracy and robustness.


By addressing these issues, the automated grading system can become much more effective and reliable.  The current implementation is a starting point, but significant improvements are needed to meet the requirements of a fully functional system.


The provided code implements an automated assessment pipeline using LangChain and LangGraph. Let's evaluate Module 6 based on the rubric:


**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompts (`review_msg`, `marks_msg`, etc.) are quite rudimentary. They lack the crucial detail of specifying how to perform the review and extraction based on the rubric and initial evaluation.  A good prompt would explicitly instruct the LLM to consider specific rubric criteria, point out inconsistencies between the student and model solutions from the earlier evaluation, and explain precisely what format the final marks should be in (e.g.,  "Based on the provided rubric and the initial comparison between the student's and model solutions, provide a revised evaluation and assign marks for each criterion.  Present the final marks as a dictionary with criterion names as keys and corresponding marks as values.").  Therefore, this section scores **1 mark**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code doesn't actually parse or extract the reviewed evaluation and adjustments from the LLM's response. The `reviewEvaluation` and `marksExtraction` functions simply invoke the LLM; they don't process the LLM's output to isolate the relevant information (revised evaluation and marks).  The `evaluate_submission` function does some extraction, but only from pre-defined strings, not the LLM's output.  This receives **0 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code saves the final marks to `final_evaluation.txt`. This fulfills the state-saving requirement, so this section gets **1 mark**.


**Total for Review Evaluation Method: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 marks**


**Overall Feedback:**

The core idea of using a LangChain/LangGraph pipeline for automated assessment is sound. However, the implementation is significantly lacking in the prompt engineering and output processing aspects.  The current prompts are too generic to elicit a structured and usable response from the LLM. The code also needs substantial revision to effectively handle the LLM's output and extract the necessary information for grading.  The `evaluate_submission` function is a separate, hardcoded evaluation, not an LLM-based one as intended by the module.

To improve:

1. **Refine Prompts:**  Craft detailed prompts that explicitly instruct the LLM on how to use the rubric and initial evaluation results to generate a structured revised evaluation and marks. Include examples of the desired output format.
2. **Implement Output Parsing:** Add code to parse the LLM's responses from `reviewEvaluation` and `marksExtraction`.  This likely involves regular expressions, string manipulation, and potentially more sophisticated NLP techniques to extract the numerical marks and qualitative feedback.
3. **Integrate LLM-based Evaluation:** The `evaluate_submission` function should be removed, or replaced by an LLM-based method that uses the LLM's response for grading, instead of hard-coded logic.
4. **Error Handling:** Add error handling to gracefully manage situations where the LLM returns unexpected or malformed responses.
5. **Testing:** Thoroughly test the pipeline with various student submissions and rubrics to ensure accuracy and robustness.


The current implementation demonstrates a basic framework but fails to address the core functionality of reviewing and correcting evaluations using the LLM effectively.  Significant improvements are needed to achieve a higher score on the rubric.


The provided code implements an automated grading system using Langchain and LangGraph.  Let's evaluate the `marksExtraction` module against the rubric.

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt `marks_msg = SystemMessage(content="Extract marks based on the rubric and review.")` is fairly concise.  It's clear, but it lacks specificity.  It doesn't instruct the LLM on the *format* of the output (e.g., "comma-separated values,"  "a dictionary with class names as keys," etc.). This makes parsing the response more challenging and prone to errors.  Therefore, I'd rate it as **2 marks**.  A better prompt would include explicit instructions on the desired output format.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code *doesn't* actually extract marks from the LLM response. The `marksExtraction` function simply invokes the LLM with the prompt and returns the LLM's response.  There's no code to parse the response and extract the comma-separated marks.  This receives **0 marks**.  The `evaluate_submission` function in the testing section does the marking, but this is not part of the `marksExtraction` node, which is what the rubric evaluates.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The function adds the LLM response to the `MessagesState` object, which is a correct way to save the state. Therefore, this receives **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Marks Extraction Module: 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 marks / 6 marks**

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Improve the Prompt:**  The prompt should specify the desired output format. For example:

   ```python
   marks_msg = SystemMessage(content="Extract marks based on the rubric and review.  Return the marks as a comma-separated string: 'Class1_marks,Class2_marks,...'. If a class is not mentioned in the review, use 0.")
   ```

2. **Add Parsing Logic:**  The `marksExtraction` function needs to be significantly modified to handle the LLM's response.  This might involve regular expressions, string splitting, or other parsing techniques depending on the LLM's output.  Example (assuming comma-separated format):

   ```python
   import re

   def marksExtraction(state: MessagesState):
       llm_response = llm.invoke([marks_msg] + state["messages"])
       marks_string = llm_response[0].content # Assuming marks are in the first message of the response
       marks_list = re.split(r',', marks_string.strip()) #Split by commas and remove whitespace
       try:
           marks = [int(x) for x in marks_list] # Convert to integers
           state["marks"] = marks #Save marks in state
           return {"messages": [llm_response[0]] + state["messages"]} #Update messages in state
       except ValueError:
           print("Error: Could not parse marks from LLM response.")
           state["marks"] = [] #Handle errors with empty list
           return {"messages": [llm_response[0]] + state["messages"]}
   ```

3. **Error Handling:** The improved `marksExtraction` includes basic error handling.  More robust error handling should be implemented to deal with various potential issues (e.g., the LLM not providing marks in the expected format, unexpected characters in the response).

4. **Testing:** The provided test is a standalone function that doesn't integrate with the Langchain/LangGraph pipeline.  The testing should be updated to use the `react_graph.execute()` function and properly extract marks from the updated `marksExtraction` node.  The current testing only demonstrates a simplified marking scheme, not the actual LLM-based marking intended in the code.


By addressing these points, the `marksExtraction` module can achieve a much higher score on the rubric.  The current implementation is incomplete and needs significant revision to correctly fulfill its function.


The provided code implements a LangChain-based automated grading system, but it falls short in several key areas concerning the "Total Marks Calculation" module (Module 8) as defined by the rubric. Let's break down the assessment based on the rubric criteria:


**6. Total Marks Calculation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (0 marks):** The `totalMarksCalculation` function uses the LLM with the prompt: `"Calculate total marks for each student based on individual question marks."` This prompt is entirely ineffective.  It doesn't provide the LLM with any individual question marks; it only requests a calculation without providing the necessary input data.  The LLM has no information to perform the calculation.  Therefore, it receives 0 marks for prompt design.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):**  Since the prompt is ineffective, the LLM's output will be nonsensical. Consequently, there's no correct information to extract.  The code doesn't attempt sophisticated parsing of the LLM's response, relying on a simple `if "marks" in message.content.lower():` which will likely fail.  This receives 0 marks.

* **State Saving (0 marks):** The code attempts to save the results to `final_evaluation.txt`, but because the LLM receives no usable input and the parsing is inadequate, the saved state will be incorrect or nonexistent. This receives 0 marks.


**Overall Module 8 Score: 0 / 6**

**Reasons for Failure and Improvements:**

1. **Missing Data Passing:** The crucial flaw is the absence of a mechanism to pass the individual question marks (obtained from previous nodes) to the `totalMarksCalculation` node. The current implementation only passes all previous messages, including the code and rubric, to the LLM, but these are not structured in a way that the LLM can easily extract and use to sum the marks.

2. **Poor Prompt Engineering:** The prompt needs significant improvement. It needs to explicitly instruct the LLM:
    * **To extract the scores from the previous evaluation stages.** This might involve identifying specific keywords or sections within the messages that represent individual question marks.
    * **To provide the sum in a clear and easily parsable format.** For example, the LLM could be prompted to output:  `"Total Marks: 75"`.

3. **Lack of Robust Parsing:** The code's parsing of the LLM's response is naive. It should use regular expressions or more advanced techniques to reliably extract the numerical total marks from the LLM's output, even if the format is slightly different from what's expected.

4. **External Evaluation Function:** The `evaluate_submission` function performs the actual mark calculation *outside* the LangChain pipeline. This defeats the purpose of using LangChain for automated grading, removing its flexibility and dynamic response capabilities.


**Suggested Improvements:**

1. **Modify Nodes:**  Structure the intermediate messages so that the marks for each section are clearly indicated.  For example,  the `marksExtraction` node should output messages like: `"Correctness: 70`, `"Code Quality: 20`, `"Constraints: 10"`.

2. **Revised `totalMarksCalculation` Prompt:**
   ```
   "Based on the previous messages, extract the scores for 'Correctness', 'Code Quality', and 'Constraints'. Calculate and output the total marks as 'Total Marks: <sum_of_scores>'."
   ```

3. **Robust Parsing:** Use regular expressions to reliably extract the number after `"Total Marks: "` in the LLM's response.

4. **Integrate Evaluation:** Remove the external `evaluate_submission` function.  Let the LLM handle the complete mark calculation and extraction within the LangChain pipeline.


By addressing these points, the `totalMarksCalculation` module can be made functional and achieve a much higher score on the rubric.  The image of the graph is largely irrelevant to this specific rubric item. The core issue is the pipeline's data handling and prompt design for the final summation step.


The provided notebook demonstrates a LangChain application using LangGraph to build an automated grading pipeline. Let's evaluate it against the provided rubric.

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  All the modules (classExtraction, rubricExtraction, initialEvaluation, reviewEvaluation, marksExtraction, totalMarksCalculation) are correctly added as nodes.  **5 marks**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The edges correctly represent the flow, including the conditional edge from `initialEvaluation` back to `classExtraction` based on the `should_recheck_classes` function. The `should_continue` function isn't directly used to define edges but implicitly controls the termination of the graph traversal. **5 marks**

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The graph is correctly compiled using `builder.compile()`. The resulting graph is visualized, demonstrating the successful compilation.  **4 marks**


**Total for Graph Construction: 14 / 14**

**Overall Assessment:**

The notebook successfully implements the LangGraph workflow as specified. The code is well-structured, and the use of conditional edges to handle feedback loops showcases a good understanding of LangGraph's capabilities.  The visualization of the graph is a helpful addition.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Robust Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling.  The `llm.invoke` calls could fail (e.g., API issues, rate limits). Adding `try-except` blocks would make the pipeline more robust.

* **More Realistic Evaluation:** The `evaluate_submission` function is a placeholder. A real-world application would require a much more sophisticated evaluation strategy, likely involving comparing the extracted classes and rubric criteria more thoroughly, perhaps using techniques like diffing or semantic similarity analysis.  The current evaluation is overly simplistic and doesn't leverage the LLM's capabilities within the graph.

* **Clearer LLM Prompts:** While prompts are provided, they could be more precise and structured to guide the LLM more effectively. Consider adding examples to the prompts for better results.

* **Output Formatting:** The output of the LLM needs careful handling to extract the marks reliably. The current placeholder code assumes a very specific format that the LLM might not produce.  Use regular expressions or other techniques to parse the LLMâ€™s output more robustly.

* **Integration of `should_continue`:** While the `should_continue` function is present, it's not directly used in edge definition.  It's better practice to integrate this explicitly into the LangGraph structure for clearer control flow.


By addressing these improvements, the notebook would become a significantly more powerful and practical example of automated grading with LangChain and LangGraph.


This Jupyter Notebook outlines a system for automated grading of Java code using Langchain and LangGraph.  However, the current implementation has several issues and is incomplete. Let's break down the problems and suggest improvements.


**Problems:**

1. **Incomplete Evaluation Logic:** The `evaluate_submission` function is a rudimentary placeholder.  It only checks for the presence of specific keywords (`Scanner`, `toUpperCase()`, `StringBuilder`, `length()`, `class StringManipulator`) in the student's code.  This is insufficient for robust grading. A true evaluation would require comparing the student's output with the expected output for various inputs, checking for proper exception handling, analyzing code style beyond simple keyword checks, and rigorously adhering to the rubric's detailed criteria.

2. **Incorrect String Reversal:** The student's solution contains a flawed string reversal loop (`for (int i = 0; i <= input.length(); i++)`). This will result in an `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. The evaluation doesn't catch this critical error.

3. **Incorrect Lowercase Conversion:** The student's code uses `toLowerCase()` instead of `toUpperCase()`, which is a significant error.  The current evaluation only partially detects this (it gives partial credit).

4. **Unutilized Langchain/LangGraph:** The Langchain LLM (`llm`) and the LangGraph (`react_graph`) are set up but never used in the final evaluation. The entire evaluation happens within a simple `evaluate_submission` function, ignoring the more sophisticated capabilities of the designed pipeline.

5. **Missing Error Handling:** There's no error handling for potential exceptions during LLM calls or file operations.

6. **Hardcoded Solutions and Rubric:** The model solution, student solution, and rubric are hardcoded. A practical system would allow for dynamic input of these elements.


**Improved Code:**

This revised code addresses the major shortcomings:

**Key Improvements:**

* **LLM-Based Evaluation:** The core evaluation logic now relies on the `llm` to compare the extracted classes, apply the rubric, and determine a score. This is much more accurate and flexible than keyword matching.
* **Fixed Student Code:** The student's string reversal and lowercase conversion errors are corrected.
* **Regular Expression for Marks Extraction:** Uses `re.search` to reliably extract the total marks from the LLM's response.
* **Error Handling:** Includes a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during LLM invocation.
* **Clearer Function Separation:** The code is better organized into functions with clear purposes.
* **Improved Prompting:** The prompts given to the LLM are more specific and guide it to provide the required information.

**Further Enhancements:**

* **Input from Files:** Modify the code to read the model solution, student solution, and rubric from files instead of hardcoding them.
* **More Robust Rubric Parsing:** Develop a more sophisticated method for parsing the rubric and extracting grading criteria.  Consider using techniques like JSON or structured text formats for the rubric.
* **Unit Testing:** Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of the evaluation logic.
* **Input Validation:** Add input validation to handle various file formats and potential errors in the student code.
* **More Sophisticated Code Analysis:** Integrate more advanced code analysis tools to assess code style, complexity, and adherence to best practices.


Remember to replace `"your_openai_api_key"` with your actual OpenAI API key.  This improved code provides a more functional framework, but further development is needed to achieve a truly robust and reliable automated grading system.  The LLM's responses are crucial for the success of this approach; carefully crafting prompts will significantly impact the quality of the evaluation.
