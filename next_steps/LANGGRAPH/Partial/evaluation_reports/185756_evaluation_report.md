## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 38/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [5/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt design for class extraction is effective and clearly instructs the LLM to extract individual Java classes, including their names and code.  It's concise and unambiguous.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The `parse_extracted_classes` function correctly parses the LLM's output and extracts class names and code.  The logic is well-structured and efficient.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The student's code extracts classes from the model solution but does not save the extracted model solution classes within the `EvaluationState`. This prevents further usage of model solutions in downstream methods, such as `initial_evaluation`.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [6/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt effectively instructs the LLM to extract relevant rubric details for each class.  Clear and concise.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The rubric details are correctly extracted and stored in the `EvaluationState`.  No issues observed.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are properly saved within the `EvaluationState` dictionary, making them readily available for subsequent modules.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [6/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt for initial evaluation is comprehensive, including all necessary inputs (student code, model solution, rubric).  Well-structured and clear.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The function correctly extracts the evaluation comments and scores, provided the LLM's response is well-formatted.

**3.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The initial evaluations are correctly saved in the `EvaluationState`.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [6/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt for reviewing evaluations is well-written, guiding the LLM to correct inaccuracies and provide a complete assessment.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are correctly extracted from the LLM's response.

**4.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The final evaluations are stored correctly in the `EvaluationState`.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [4/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt clearly instructs the LLM to extract marks; it is well-structured and unambiguous.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The regular expression used (`re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)`) is flawed.  It extracts any number, which may not always be the correct mark.  It lacks robustness and needs refinement to ensure only the relevant marks are extracted.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State management for extracted marks is partially implemented but fails to handle cases where no marks are extracted (empty string handling) leading to potential errors later.



#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt for using the `sum_marks` tool is straightforward and appropriate.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The final sum is correctly extracted from the tool's output.

**6.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The total marks are saved correctly in the `EvaluationState`.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All nodes are correctly added to the LangGraph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges connecting the nodes are correctly defined, representing the workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles successfully, indicating a proper workflow structure.

---

**Feedback:**  
The code demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph and the overall evaluation process.  The prompt designs are clear and effective. However, the `marks_extraction` module needs significant improvement. The regular expression is too simplistic and lacks error handling.  Focus on enhancing the robustness of the mark extraction and state management for more reliable results.

**Changes Made and Grading Rubric Considerations:**

1. **File Extensions:** The code assumes the input files (`model_solution`, `student_solution`) are Java files (`.java`).  The original notebook used `.md` which is incorrect for code.  I've updated the code to reflect this assumption.  **If the provided files are not .java, no marks should be awarded for the code execution portion.**

2. **Error Handling (Mermaid Graph):**  The generation of the `workflow.png` using `app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()` can fail depending on the installation and configuration of the `langgraph` library and its dependencies.  A `try-except` block has been added to catch and report this error. This doesn't affect the core functionality but avoids a crash.

3. **API Key:** Remember to replace `"AIzaSyC2YsRBIWdBLBRzWJrWRAo820ImfNUKNPo"` with your actual Google Cloud API key.  **Without a valid API key, the code will not run correctly and no marks should be awarded for the LLM interaction sections.**

4. **LLM Interaction:** The code correctly invokes the LLM multiple times using `llm.invoke()`, passing appropriate prompts. The parsing of the LLM's output and updating the state are done as per the model solution's implied structure.  This should receive full marks according to the rubric if a valid API key is used and the LLM responses are successfully parsed.

5. **Deprecation Warning:** A deprecation warning is expected related to `BaseTool.__call__`.  The rubric states that no marks should be deducted for this.

6. **Input Files:** You **must** provide the `question.md`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.md`, and `student_solution.java` files in the same directory as the Python script.  **Without these files, the code will not run, and no marks should be awarded.**


**Grading:**

To grade this, follow these steps:

1. **Replace API Key:** Substitute your actual Google Cloud API key.
2. **Provide Input Files:** Ensure you have the necessary `.java` and `.md` files.
3. **Run the Code:** Execute the modified Python script.
4. **Check Output:** Examine `final_evaluations.txt` for the results.  The total marks calculated should be accurate based on the LLM's evaluation.
5. **Check `workflow.png`:** If the graph is generated correctly, it demonstrates correct graph construction.

**Marks Allocation (Based on the Rubric):**

* **LLM Invocation (Correctly invoking `llm.invoke()` in all nodes):**  A significant portion of the marks should be allocated here (approximately 30-35 points).  Each successful and correctly formatted LLM call contributes.  Failure due to API key issues or LLM unavailability results in zero marks for this section.
* **State Management (Correctly parsing LLM output, updating state, and passing the state between nodes):** A substantial portion of the marks (approximately 10-15 points) should be allocated here.  Correct data handling and state transitions are vital.
* **Graph Construction (Adding nodes and edges in the graph, setting the entry point, compiling the graph):** Allocate approximately 5 points for the correct graph structure.  This is independent of LLM success.
* **`sum_marks` Tool:** Allocate 1-2 points for the correct implementation of the custom tool.
* **`parse_extracted_classes`:** Allocate 1-2 points for the correct parsing of the class extraction output.
* **Output and File Handling:** Allocate 2-3 points for the correct generation and saving of the `final_evaluations.txt` file.


The exact breakdown of points within each category depends on the level of detail in the model solution and the specific requirements not fully described in the provided rubric.  The above is a reasonable interpretation given the information provided. Remember to deduct marks for missing functionality as specified in the rubric.


### RUBRIC MODULE: Module 2 - Evaluation

This evaluation assesses the student's Jupyter Notebook submission based on the provided code and instructions.  The rubric focuses on functionality and code correctness.  No points are awarded for style or comments unless explicitly stated in the rubric (which it is not).  The absence of required files (`question.md`, `model_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `student_solution.md`) prevents a complete evaluation of the code's functionality.

**Part 1: Library Imports (5 points)**

* **Points Awarded:** 5/5
* **Feedback:** All necessary libraries are correctly imported.

**Part 2: Function Definitions (20 points)**

* **Points Awarded:** 16/20
* **Feedback:** 
    * `read_file`, `sum_marks`, and `parse_extracted_classes` functions are implemented correctly.  
    * The `parse_extracted_classes` function has limitations. It relies on a very simplistic parsing scheme that might fail given varied Java class structures.  A more robust solution using a proper parser would be ideal.
    * The LangChain functions (`class_extraction`, `rubric_extraction`, `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`, `marks_extraction`) are correctly structured to use the LLM, but their effectiveness is untested due to the missing files.  The usage of `result.content` directly assumes successful LLM invocation; error handling is absent.
    * `total_marks_calculation` and `save_final_evaluation` functions appear correct, pending the successful execution of preceding functions.
    * A warning is displayed about deprecated LangChain functionality. The student should update the code to use the `invoke` method.

**Part 3: Graph Construction (15 points)**

* **Points Awarded:** 10/15
* **Feedback:**
    * The StateGraph is correctly initialized.
    * Nodes are correctly added, though functionality depends on the LLM and input files.
    * Edges are correctly added to represent the workflow.
    * The `set_entry_point` is used appropriately.
    * However, the graph compilation and image generation (`app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()`)  succeed,  but the resultant PNG cannot be assessed because we cannot view the actual graph without the execution and the proper input files.  The code does generate a `workflow.png` but without input files, it's impossible to verify its correctness.


**Part 4: Workflow Execution (10 points)**

* **Points Awarded:** 0/10
* **Feedback:** The workflow execution cannot be evaluated without the necessary input files (`question.md`, `model_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `student_solution.md`).  The code compiles without errors, but the functions are not tested.

**Part 5: Graph Display (5 points)**

* **Points Awarded:** 0/5
* **Feedback:**  The graph display is attempted, but it's impossible to assess the output without executing the entire workflow and obtaining a correct `workflow.png`.


**Total Points Awarded: 31/55**

**Overall Feedback:**

The code demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph and the overall structure of the automatic evaluation system. The functions are largely well-written, but their effectiveness is contingent on the presence of input files and addressing the limitations in `parse_extracted_classes`.  Robust error handling and improved class extraction are crucial for making the system reliable. The student should replace the place-holder API key with their actual key and provide the necessary files for complete evaluation.  Addressing the deprecated LangChain warning is also recommended.


## Module 3 Rubric Assessment

Here's an assessment of Module 3 based on the provided code and rubric.

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt `"Extract individual Java classes from the following code:\n\n{code}\n\nFor each class, provide the class name and its code."` is reasonably good.  It clearly instructs the LLM what to do. However, it uses a single prompt for both student and model solutions, which could be improved by using separate prompts for better control and clarity.  Therefore, this falls into the **2 marks** category.  Separate prompts would have allowed for more tailored instructions if needed (e.g., specifying potential differences in coding style between student and model solutions).

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `parse_extracted_classes` function attempts to extract class names and code based on the "class" keyword and curly braces. While this approach works for simple cases, it's fragile and might fail with nested classes, complex imports, or unusual formatting.  The regex in `marks_extraction` is also simplistic and could miss edge cases.  Considering the limitations, this achieves **1 mark**.  More robust parsing techniques (using an Abstract Syntax Tree parser or a dedicated Java parser) would significantly improve accuracy.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly uses the `EvaluationState` TypedDict to save extracted class information (`extracted_classes`). This receives **1 mark**.

**Total for Extract Class Method: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 marks**


**Overall Feedback:**

The code demonstrates a basic workflow for automated code evaluation. The use of LangChain and a state graph is a good approach for structuring the process. However, the core weakness lies in the robustness of the LLM prompts and the parsing functions.  The reliance on simple keyword-based parsing and regex makes the system prone to errors when dealing with real-world Java code, which can be significantly more complex.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Improve Prompt Engineering:** Use separate prompts for student and model solutions. Experiment with different prompt phrasing to improve the quality and consistency of the LLM's output.  Consider providing examples of expected output formats within the prompts.

2. **Robust Parsing:**  Replace the current parsing methods with a more sophisticated technique.  A Java parser (e.g., using a library like JavaParser) would provide much more accurate and reliable class extraction.

3. **Error Handling:** Add more comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage cases where the LLM's output is unexpected or the parsing fails.  Logging mechanisms would greatly help in debugging.

4. **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the system with diverse examples of student and model solutions, including cases with edge-case code structures.  This will reveal weaknesses in the current implementation and guide improvements.

5. **Mark Extraction Robustness:** Improve the regex or use a more advanced method to extract numeric marks from the evaluation text.  Natural Language Processing techniques could improve the accuracy of this step.


By addressing these points, the module could achieve a much higher score and provide a more reliable automated code evaluation system.


## Module 4 Rubric Assessment

This assessment evaluates the `rubric_extraction` module based on the provided rubric.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt: `"Given the following rubric:\n\n{rubric}\n\nExtract the relevant rubric details for the Java class named {class_name}."` is reasonably good. It clearly instructs the LLM what to do and includes placeholders for the rubric and class name. However, it lacks explicit instructions on the *format* of the extracted details.  The LLM might return information in various unstructured formats, making parsing difficult.  This lack of specificity reduces the score.

    * **Score: 2 marks.**  The prompt is mostly complete but could be significantly improved by specifying the desired output format (e.g., JSON, a table, key-value pairs).

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code uses `result.content` directly without any sophisticated parsing.  This is risky because the LLM's output is unpredictable. While the `parse_extracted_classes` function shows an attempt at structured extraction, no similar parsing is applied to the rubric extraction.  This makes the extraction unreliable and prone to failure depending on the LLM's response.

    * **Score: 1 mark.** Partial extraction; the code relies heavily on the LLM's output being consistently formatted, which is unlikely.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The rubric details are saved in `state['extracted_rubrics']`, which is a dictionary keyed by class names. This is a correct and appropriate way to store the data for later use.

    * **Score: 1 mark.** Saved correctly.


**Total Score for Extract Rubric Method: 4 / 6**


**Overall Feedback:**

The `rubric_extraction` function is a crucial part of the evaluation pipeline.  Its current implementation is too simplistic and unreliable.  The main weakness is the lack of robust parsing of the LLM's output. The prompt could also benefit from more specific instructions on the desired format and content of the extracted rubric details.   To improve this module:


1. **Improve Prompt Design:**  Specify the desired output format (e.g., JSON). For example: `"Given the following rubric:\n\n{rubric}\n\nExtract the relevant rubric details for the Java class named {class_name}. Return the details in JSON format with the following keys: 'criteria', 'weighting', 'description'."`

2. **Implement Robust Parsing:** Use regular expressions or a more sophisticated parsing library (like `json.loads()` if using JSON) to extract the rubric details from the LLM's response.  Handle potential errors and edge cases gracefully.  Error handling should be added to the parsing stage to manage cases where the LLM's response is not in the expected format.

3. **Add Input Validation:** Consider adding input validation to check if the extracted class names actually exist in the student's code to prevent unexpected errors.

4. **Consider a Schema:**  Define a clear schema (data structure) for the rubric elements before writing the prompt. This will improve both prompt design and parsing.  The schema could be enforced using a schema validation library after parsing.


By addressing these points, the reliability and robustness of the `rubric_extraction` module can be greatly enhanced.  This would lead to a more accurate and complete automated evaluation system.


The provided code implements a LangChain-based workflow for automatically evaluating student code. Let's evaluate Module 5 based on the given rubric:


**3. Initial Evaluation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in the `initial_evaluation` function is well-structured. It clearly includes spaces for student code, model solution, and rubric.  It requests a detailed evaluation with scores and comments.  **Score: 3/3**

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to extract marks using a regular expression in `marks_extraction`. However, this regex (`re.findall(r'\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\b', result.content)`) is flawed. It's escaping backslashes unnecessarily and might miss marks formatted differently (e.g., "2.5/3").  It also doesn't handle potential errors robustly.  The extraction is incomplete and prone to failure.  **Score: 1/2**

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `EvaluationState` TypedDict effectively manages the workflow's state, and the `save_final_evaluation` function saves the results to `final_evaluations.txt`.  **Score: 1/1**


**Total Score for Module 5: 5/6**


**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Robust Mark Extraction:** The regular expression in `marks_extraction` needs significant improvement.  Consider using a more sophisticated method, potentially involving NLP techniques to identify and extract numerical scores within the context of the evaluation text. Error handling should be incorporated to gracefully manage cases where marks aren't found or are in unexpected formats.

2. **Prompt Engineering:** While the prompts are structured, they could be improved through more precise instructions and examples.  The LLM might produce better results with more carefully crafted prompts, demonstrating the expected output format (e.g., providing a sample evaluation with the desired score structure).

3. **Error Handling:** The code lacks comprehensive error handling.  What happens if the LLM call fails?  What if a file is not found?  Adding `try...except` blocks would make the workflow more robust.

4. **Class Extraction Robustness:** The `parse_extracted_classes` function relies on simple string manipulation to identify classes.  This is fragile and might fail with more complex Java code.  A more reliable approach might use an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser for Java code.

5. **API Key Management:**  Hardcoding the Google API key is a security risk.  Best practice is to store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables.


**Revised `marks_extraction` function (example):**

```python
import re

def extract_marks(text):
    # More robust regex, allowing for different formats
    marks = re.findall(r"(\d+(\.\d+)?|\d+)/?\d*", text)  
    return ",".join([mark[0] for mark in marks]) if marks else ""


def marks_extraction(state: EvaluationState, llm: BaseLLM) -> EvaluationState:
    prompt = "From the following evaluation, extract a comma-separated list of marks awarded for each criterion:\n\n{evaluation}"

    for class_name, evaluation in state['final_evaluations'].items():
        try:
            result = llm.invoke(prompt.format(evaluation=evaluation))
            state['extracted_marks'][class_name] = extract_marks(result.content)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error extracting marks for {class_name}: {e}")
            state['extracted_marks'][class_name] = "" # Handle error gracefully

    return state

```

By addressing these improvements, the module's reliability and accuracy would be significantly enhanced.


This code implements a workflow for automated essay grading using LangChain, LangGraph, and Google's Gemini. Let's evaluate it against the provided rubric.

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt for `review_evaluation` is:  `"Review and correct if necessary the following evaluation:\n\n{initial_evaluation}\n\nProvide a final assessment ensuring all evaluations are accurate and complete."`  This is a decent prompt, but it could be improved.  It lacks specific instructions on *how* to correct the evaluation (e.g., referencing specific rubric criteria, providing justifications for changes).  A better prompt would guide the LLM more precisely.  Therefore, I'd give it **2 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The `marks_extraction` function uses a regular expression (`re.findall(r'\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\b', result.content)`) to extract numerical marks. This is a fragile approach; it might miss marks if they're not formatted exactly as expected (e.g., "3/5", "2.5 out of 3").  It also doesn't handle potential errors in the LLM's output gracefully. A more robust method would involve named entity recognition (NER) or a more sophisticated parsing technique.  Therefore, I'd give it **1 mark**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The `save_final_evaluation` function correctly saves the reviewed evaluations and total marks to `final_evaluations.txt`.  This gets **1 mark**.

**Total for Review Evaluation Method: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 marks**


**Overall Feedback:**

The code demonstrates a functional automated essay grading system. However, the robustness and accuracy could be significantly improved. Here are some specific suggestions:

* **Improved Prompt Engineering:**  The prompts should be more specific and include examples to guide the LLM.  Consider using few-shot learning within prompts to provide the LLM with examples of correct evaluations and mark extraction.

* **Robust Parsing:** Replace the regular expression in `marks_extraction` with a more robust method.  Consider using a library like spaCy or Stanford NER for named entity recognition to extract marks more reliably.  Add error handling to deal with unexpected LLM output.

* **Structured Output from LLM:** Encourage the LLM to provide structured output (e.g., JSON) instead of free text, making parsing significantly easier and more reliable.  This requires modifying the prompts to explicitly request structured output.

* **Error Handling:**  The code lacks comprehensive error handling.  Add `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors during file reading, LLM invocation, and parsing.

* **Modularity:** Consider breaking down the long functions (`class_extraction`, `initial_evaluation`, etc.) into smaller, more manageable functions for better readability and maintainability.

* **API Key Security:** Avoid hardcoding the Google API key directly in the code. Use environment variables for better security.


By addressing these points, the code's accuracy, robustness, and maintainability can be substantially enhanced.  The current implementation is a good starting point but needs further refinement to be truly effective and reliable for automated essay grading.


Let's analyze the code and assess it against the provided rubric.

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt in the `marks_extraction` function is: `"From the following evaluation, extract a comma-separated list of marks awarded for each criterion:\\n\\n{evaluation}"`.  This prompt is fairly clear and instructs the LLM to extract numerical marks. However, it doesn't explicitly handle potential issues like non-numerical values in the evaluation or missing marks.  A more robust prompt would specify the expected format more precisely (e.g., "Extract a comma-separated list of floating-point numbers representing marks...") and include examples.  Therefore, I'd give it **2 marks**.  It's mostly complete but lacks robustness and examples.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code uses `re.findall(r'\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?\\b', result.content)` to extract numerical marks. This regex is a good starting point, capturing numbers with optional decimal points. However, it might fail if the marks are formatted differently (e.g., embedded in sentences, using different separators).  It also doesn't handle errors gracefully (e.g., if the regex finds nothing).  Therefore, I would give it **1 mark**. It achieves partial extraction, but robustness is lacking.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The extracted marks are correctly saved into `state['extracted_marks'][class_name]`. The `total_marks_calculation` function then correctly aggregates these marks. This part of the code functions as intended.  Therefore, I'd give this section **1 mark**.


**Total for Marks Extraction Method: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 marks**

**Overall Feedback:**

The code attempts to solve the problem of automated marking, but it relies heavily on the LLM's ability to produce perfectly formatted output.  The robustness and error handling in both prompt design and parsing are weak points.  To improve:


1. **Improve Prompt Engineering:**  Craft more precise and robust prompts, include examples of expected input and output, and handle edge cases (e.g., missing marks, non-numerical values).

2. **Enhance Parsing:** Consider more sophisticated parsing techniques than regular expressions.  Libraries like `spaCy` or custom parsing logic could better handle variations in LLM output.  Add error handling to gracefully manage unexpected formats.

3. **Input Validation:** Add validation steps to check the extracted marks before summing them.  This could involve type checking and range checking to avoid unexpected errors from invalid input.

4. **Logging:** Incorporate better logging to track the LLM responses and any issues during parsing or extraction.  This aids debugging and understanding the system's performance.

5. **Testing:** Write unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the `marks_extraction` function and the overall workflow.


By addressing these points, the code's reliability and the accuracy of the final mark will be greatly improved.  The current implementation is functional but fragile; improvements in robustness are key to achieving a higher score on the rubric.


This code implements a workflow for evaluating student code using LangChain, LangGraph, and Google Generative AI. Let's analyze the `total_marks_calculation` function and its interaction with the rubric according to the provided rubric.

**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The `total_marks_calculation` function does *not* use a prompt. It directly uses the `sum_marks` tool, passing it a comma-separated string of marks extracted in a previous step. This is a strength of the code; it avoids unnecessary LLM calls.  Therefore, it scores **3 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The function correctly extracts the final sum returned by the `sum_marks` tool and assigns it to `state['total_marks']`.  This is fully correct. Therefore, it scores **2 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The final total is saved in the `EvaluationState` dictionary under the key `total_marks`.  This is correctly saved. Therefore, it scores **1 mark**.

**Total Score for Module 8 (Total Marks Calculation Method): 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 marks**

**Improvements and Observations:**

* **Error Handling:** The `sum_marks` tool includes basic error handling for non-numeric values.  More robust error handling could be added to the `total_marks_calculation` function itself to gracefully handle cases where `state['extracted_marks']` might be empty or contain unexpected data.

* **Clarity:** While functional, the code could benefit from more descriptive variable names and comments to enhance readability. For example,  `all_marks` could be `combined_marks_string`.

* **Data Validation:**  Before calling `sum_marks`, it would be wise to add a check to ensure that `all_marks` is not empty. An empty string could crash the `sum_marks` function.

* **Dependency Management:** The code uses hardcoded API key. For better practice, API keys should be managed using environment variables to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information to version control.


**Revised `total_marks_calculation` function with improvements:**

```python
def total_marks_calculation(state: EvaluationState) -> EvaluationState:
    """Calculates the total marks and saves it to the state.  Includes improved error handling."""
    combined_marks_string = ",".join(state['extracted_marks'].values())
    if not combined_marks_string:  #Handle empty case
        print("Warning: No marks extracted for total calculation. Setting total marks to 0.")
        state['total_marks'] = 0.0
    else:
        state['total_marks'] = sum_marks(combined_marks_string)
    return state

```

This revised function addresses the potential for an empty `combined_marks_string` and provides a more informative message if this occurs.  The rest of the code's functionality for total marks calculation remains strong.


The provided code implements a LangGraph workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's assess it against the rubric.


**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The code correctly adds all six modules (`class_extraction`, `rubric_extraction`, `initial_evaluation`, `review_evaluation`, `marks_extraction`, `total_marks_calculation`) as nodes to the `workflow` StateGraph.  **5 marks**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code correctly adds edges to connect the nodes in the intended sequence. The flow is sequential: `class_extraction` -> `rubric_extraction` -> `initial_evaluation` -> `review_evaluation` -> `marks_extraction` -> `total_marks_calculation`. **5 marks**

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The line `app = workflow.compile()` compiles the graph.  This appears to be the correct method call for LangGraph. The subsequent `app.invoke(initial_state)` executes the workflow. **4 marks**


**Total for Graph Construction: 14 / 14**

**Overall Comments:**

The code demonstrates a well-structured LangGraph workflow.  All modules are correctly added as nodes, edges represent the correct dependencies, and the graph compilation and execution are implemented correctly.  The use of a `TypedDict` for the state is good practice, improving code readability and maintainability.  The inclusion of error handling in the `sum_marks` function is also a positive aspect.


**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Error Handling:** While `sum_marks` handles invalid marks, more robust error handling could be added throughout the workflow. For example,  handling potential exceptions from the LLM calls (`llm.invoke`) would make the system more resilient. Consider using `try-except` blocks around these calls to catch potential errors and log them appropriately.

* **Input Validation:**  Add input validation to ensure that the files (`question.md`, `model_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, `student_solution.md`) exist and contain the expected data before the workflow starts.  This would prevent unexpected errors during execution.

* **LLM Choice:** The code uses a Google Generative AI model.  Consider adding the ability to select different LLMs as this would improve flexibility.

* **Modularity:** While the code is well-structured, further modularity could be achieved by separating the LLM interaction logic into separate functions, making the code more reusable and easier to test.

* **Output Clarity:** The `save_final_evaluation` function saves results to a text file.  Consider providing more structured output (e.g., JSON) that’s easier to parse and analyze programmatically.


Despite these minor suggestions, the code successfully fulfills the requirements of the rubric and demonstrates a solid understanding of LangGraph.


This Jupyter Notebook defines a workflow for automatically evaluating student code against a rubric and model solution using LangChain and Google Generative AI. Let's break down the code and address potential issues.

**Code Breakdown:**

1. **Import Libraries:** Imports necessary libraries including `os`, `typing`, LangChain components (`Graph`, `StateGraph`, `ToolExecutor`, `ToolInvocation`, `tool`, `BaseLLM`), the Google Generative AI LLM, and `re` for regular expressions.

2. **API Key and File Reading:** Sets a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (**Remember to replace the placeholder with your actual key!**).  The `read_file` function reads the content of files.

3. **Custom Tool and State Class:**
   - Defines a custom `sum_marks` tool using the `@tool` decorator. This tool takes a comma-separated string of marks and returns their sum, handling potential `ValueError` exceptions gracefully.
   - Defines an `EvaluationState` TypedDict to manage the workflow's state, including problem description, model solution, rubric, student code, extracted classes, extracted rubrics, initial and final evaluations, extracted marks, and total marks.

4. **LangGraph Nodes:** Defines functions as LangGraph nodes:
    - `class_extraction`: Extracts individual Java classes from the student and model code using the LLM.  It uses a helper function `parse_extracted_classes` (defined later) to process the LLM's output.
    - `rubric_extraction`: Extracts relevant rubric details for each extracted class.
    - `initial_evaluation`: Provides an initial evaluation of the student code based on the rubric and model solution.
    - `review_evaluation`: Reviews and corrects the initial evaluation.
    - `marks_extraction`: Extracts numerical marks from the final evaluations using regular expressions.
    - `total_marks_calculation`: Calculates the total marks using the `sum_marks` tool.
    - `save_final_evaluation`: Saves the final evaluations and total marks to `final_evaluations.txt`.
    - `parse_extracted_classes`:  A helper function to parse the LLM's output for class extraction, handling cases where class definitions span multiple lines.

5. **Graph Construction:**
   - The `main` function initializes the Google Generative AI LLM with your API key and temperature set to 0 (no randomness).
   - It creates a `StateGraph` with `EvaluationState` as the state type.
   - It adds nodes representing the evaluation steps, each linked to its corresponding function.
   - It adds edges to define the workflow's sequence.
   - It sets the entry point and compiles the graph.
   - It runs the workflow, saves the final evaluation, and saves a Mermaid graph visualization to `workflow.png`.

6. **Main Execution:** The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures the `main` function is executed only when the script is run directly (not imported as a module).

**Potential Issues and Improvements:**

* **API Key Security:** Hardcoding the API key directly in the script is a significant security risk.  Use environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys.

* **Error Handling:** While `sum_marks` handles invalid marks, more robust error handling is needed throughout the workflow. For instance, the LLM calls could fail, and the code should gracefully handle such scenarios.  Consider adding `try...except` blocks around LLM invocations.

* **Input File Paths:** Hardcoding file paths ("question.md", "model_solution.md", "rubric.md", "student_solution.md") limits flexibility.  Make these configurable, perhaps through command-line arguments or configuration files.

* **Regular Expression Robustness:** The regular expression `re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)` for extracting marks might be too simplistic. It could miss marks embedded in sentences or with unusual formatting.  A more sophisticated approach might be necessary.

* **LLM Prompt Engineering:** The prompts could be improved for better clarity and to guide the LLM more effectively.  Experiment with different prompt structures and provide examples to the LLM.

* **Class Extraction Reliability:** The `parse_extracted_classes` function relies on simple string manipulation.  It's likely to fail for complex Java code with nested classes, comments, or unusual formatting.  Consider using a proper Java parser for more accurate class extraction.

* **Dependency Management:** Use a requirements file (`requirements.txt`) to list the project's dependencies for easier reproducibility.


**Revised `main` function with improvements:**

```python
def main():
    try:
        # Get API key from environment variable
        GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
        if not GOOGLE_API_KEY:
            raise ValueError("GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable not set.")

        llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-1.5-flash", temperature=0, google_api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)

        # Make file paths configurable (example using command-line arguments)
        import argparse
        parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
        parser.add_argument("question_file", help="Path to the question file")
        parser.add_argument("model_solution_file", help="Path to the model solution file")
        parser.add_argument("rubric_file", help="Path to the rubric file")
        parser.add_argument("student_code_file", help="Path to the student code file")
        args = parser.parse_args()

        initial_state = EvaluationState(
            problem_description=read_file(args.question_file),
            model_solution=read_file(args.model_solution_file),
            rubric=read_file(args.rubric_file),
            marking_scheme=read_file(args.rubric_file),
            student_code=read_file(args.student_code_file),
            extracted_classes={},
            extracted_rubrics={},
            initial_evaluations={},
            final_evaluations={},
            extracted_marks={},
            total_marks=0.0
        )

        # ... (rest of the main function remains the same)

    except (ValueError, FileNotFoundError, Exception) as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

Remember to install the necessary libraries:  `pip install langchain langchain-google-genai`


This revised version addresses some key issues, but further refinement is recommended based on the complexity of the Java code and the desired robustness of the evaluation system.  Consider using a more sophisticated approach for class extraction and mark identification.  Thorough testing is crucial to identify and fix unexpected behaviors.
