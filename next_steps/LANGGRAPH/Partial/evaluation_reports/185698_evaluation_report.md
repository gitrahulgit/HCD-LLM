## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [2/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The student's attempt to extract classes uses a web-based loader to access files from a GitHub repository. This is an unconventional approach that deviates from the problem statement requiring direct file input. The prompt itself is somewhat generic, lacking specific instructions tailored to Java class structure extraction.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the output, but it doesn't correctly extract individual classes from the web-loaded content due to the nature of the web page being loaded, leading to a failure in parsing the actual content required for the program.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not properly saved into the state variable.

#### 7. Graph Construction [12/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student added nodes representing the stages of the workflow.

The student correctly connected the nodes to represent a sequential workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [2/4]:**  
The code attempts to compile the graph, but it fails to execute properly due to issues in previous steps.  Partial credit given for the attempt at graph compilation within the LangGraph framework.


---

**Feedback:**  
The code demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph's structure with the graph construction showing promise. However, the implementation heavily relies on web scraping instead of the required direct file inputs, and most crucial modules are missing.  Focus on understanding the file input requirements and implementing all missing modules, using LLMs effectively for each task.  Refine prompt engineering for accurate results.

The notebook attempts to build a Langchain application to grade student Java code based on a rubric and a model solution. However, several issues prevent successful execution and grading.  Let's evaluate based on the implied requirements.


**Evaluation Rubric (Hypothetical, based on implied requirements)**

The rubric below is inferred as no explicit rubric was provided in the student's submission.

**Part 1: Data Loading (10 points)**

* **Successfully loads rubric, model solution, and student solution (5 points):**  0/5. The code attempts to load data from GitHub using `WebBaseLoader`. However, it only retrieves the HTML source code of the GitHub pages, not the actual Markdown content of the files (rubric.md, model_solution.md, student_solution.md).  The resulting `page_content` in the `Document` objects is filled with the GitHub page's HTML, including navigation and other unrelated elements.

* **Handles potential errors during loading gracefully (5 points):** 0/5. No error handling is implemented. If a URL is invalid or the website is unreachable, the code will crash.

**Part 2: Data Processing (10 points)**

* **Splits documents into smaller chunks (5 points):** 0/5. While `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is used, it's applied to the raw HTML, resulting in meaningless chunks.  The HTML needs to be parsed first to extract the relevant text content before splitting.

* **Creates embeddings and a vector database (5 points):** 0/5. The code attempts to use `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` and `Chroma`. However,  `model="models/embedding-001"` is not a valid model name for Google Generative AI Embeddings.  Furthermore, the embeddings are created on the raw HTML, not the processed text content.  The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is requested but not necessarily correctly set or used.

**Part 3:  Retrieval Tool (10 points)**

* **Creates functioning retriever tools for rubric, model solution, and student solution (10 points):** 0/10. The retriever tools are created, but they operate on incorrect data (HTML chunks), rendering them useless.


**Part 4:  Grading Logic (20 points)**

* **Defines a clear data model for the grading output (5 points):** 5/5. The `grade` Pydantic model is well-defined.

* **Implements a grading function using a suitable LLM (10 points):** 0/10.  The grading function (`grade_documents`) is incomplete and incorrect. It's attempting to use  `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` which isn't defined in the provided code and also relies on the `student_sol` and `docs` variables being populated correctly, which they are not due to issues in earlier parts.  The logic for determining "yes" or "rewrite" is based on an unspecified assumption about the LLM's output and lacks any actual comparison or analysis of the code.

* **Handles different grading scenarios (5 points):** 0/5.  No handling of edge cases or different grading scenarios (e.g., partial credit) is implemented.

**Part 5: Agent and Workflow (20 points)**

* **Implements an agent to manage the workflow (10 points):** 2/10. The agent function (`agent`) is partially implemented but uses `ChatOpenAI` instead of the intended `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`. The tools are bound correctly.

* **Uses appropriate tools and transitions between states (10 points):** 0/10. The workflow (`agent`, `rewrite`, `generate`)  is mostly set up, but the core logic within `grade_documents` is absent, preventing the workflow from functioning correctly. The `rewrite` function attempts to rephrase the question, but the `generate` function relies on the successful completion and meaningful output of `grade_documents`.


**Part 6: Error Handling and Robustness (10 points)**

* **Handles potential errors during LLM interaction (5 points):** 0/5. No error handling is implemented for LLM calls.

* **Makes the application robust to unexpected inputs or data (5 points):** 0/5.  The application lacks robustness due to numerous data processing and LLM interaction failures.


**Total Score: 7/65**

**Feedback:**

The notebook has a good conceptual structure for a LangChain application for code grading. However, the implementation is plagued by several critical issues:

1. **Incorrect Data Handling:**  The core problem is that the code loads raw HTML instead of the intended Markdown files. This needs to be addressed first by using a proper HTML parser (like `BeautifulSoup`) to extract the content of the markdown files from the GitHub pages.

2. **Embedding Issues:** The embeddings are generated from incorrect data (HTML).  Resolve the data-loading problem first, then ensure the correct model name is used for the embeddings.  Double-check the API key is being correctly used.

3. **Incomplete Grading Logic:** The `grade_documents` function needs significant work.  The LLM prompt needs refinement to clearly instruct the model on how to compare the student's code to the model solution and the rubric.  The scoring logic should incorporate the rubric criteria.


4. **Missing Libraries:** `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` is undefined in this code. Make sure it is properly installed and imported.

To improve, focus on fixing the data loading and preprocessing steps first. Then, develop a robust and well-defined grading logic using a clear and specific LLM prompt.  Finally, thoroughly test your application with various inputs to ensure robustness.





The provided Jupyter Notebook uses Langchain to process documents from GitHub, including a rubric, a model solution, and a student solution (all assumed to be Java code).  The notebook then aims to grade the student solution.  However, the code for extracting Java classes isn't present.  The rubric for evaluating *that* specific extraction is included, and I will evaluate a hypothetical implementation based on the notebook's context.

**Hypothetical Implementation and Rubric Evaluation**

Let's assume we add a function `extract_classes` that uses an LLM to extract Java classes.

```python
import re
from langchain.llms import OpenAI # or another suitable LLM

def extract_classes(java_code: str) -> list:
    """Extracts Java class names from Java code using an LLM."""

    prompt = f"""
    Extract all the class names from the following Java code:

    ```java
    {java_code}
    ```

    Return a JSON array of strings, where each string is a class name.  If no classes are found, return an empty array `[]`.
    """

    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0) # Replace with your LLM
    response = llm(prompt)

    # Basic parsing of LLM response.  More robust parsing might be needed.
    try:
        classes = eval(response) # use carefully, sanitize for production!
        return classes
    except (SyntaxError, NameError):
        print("Error parsing LLM response. Returning empty list.")
        return []


# Example usage (assuming model_sol_content and student_sol_content contain the code)
model_classes = extract_classes(model_sol_documents[0].page_content)
student_classes = extract_classes(student_sol_documents[0].page_content)

# Save to state (Illustrative):
state = {"model_classes": model_classes, "student_classes": student_classes} 
```

**Rubric Score:**


* **1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**
    * **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt is clear, concise, and specifies the desired output format (JSON array). It provides the necessary input (Java code).  **Score: 3/3**
    * **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The parsing uses `eval()`, which is risky in a production setting and prone to errors if the LLM output isn't perfectly formatted.  A more robust JSON parser (like `json.loads()`) is recommended.  However, for this example, it attempts to handle potential errors.  **Score: 1/2** (Risk of `eval()` lowers the score).
    * **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves the extracted class information into a dictionary called `state`. **Score: 1/1**

**Total Score: 5/6**

**Improvements:**

1. **Robust Parsing:** Replace `eval()` with `json.loads()` and implement error handling for malformed JSON.  This is crucial for reliability.

2. **LLM Choice:** The choice of LLM (`OpenAI`) needs to be appropriate for the task and consider cost-effectiveness.  The code should specify an API key or other authentication methods.

3. **Regular Expression Preprocessing:** Before sending the code to the LLM, consider using regular expressions to pre-process the Java code to isolate class declarations, thus potentially improving the LLM's accuracy and efficiency.

4. **Input Sanitization:** The `eval()` function is a significant security risk; avoid it in production code.  A more robust method to parse the LLM's output would be to expect JSON and use the `json` library.  Input validation and sanitization are crucial for security.


The improved code would significantly enhance the reliability and security of the class extraction process.  The current implementation, while demonstrating the core concept, is not production-ready due to the reliance on `eval()`.


This code attempts to build a LangChain application that grades a student's Java program based on a rubric and a model solution.  Let's analyze it according to the provided rubric.

**2. Extract Rubric Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt design is partially complete (**1 mark**).  The `grade_documents` function uses a prompt that includes the student solution, the rubric, and the model solution. However, it's not efficient or robust.  It directly injects the retrieved documents into the prompt without any preprocessing or consideration for the potential length of the documents.  Long documents might lead to context window limits in the LLM and inaccurate grading. It also assumes the rubric is directly usable without any extraction or structuring of specific grading criteria.  A better design would involve extracting key criteria and weights from the rubric before feeding it to the LLM.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The output extraction is partially successful (**1 mark**). The code uses `llm_with_tool` to parse the LLM output and extract the `binary_score`.  However, this only extracts a simple "yes" or "no" or a numerical score.  The rubric likely contains more nuanced grading criteria (e.g., points for specific features), which are not extracted. This aspect needs improvement for a more comprehensive evaluation.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** State is saved correctly using the `AgentState` TypedDict and passed between functions (**1 mark**). The `agent`, `rewrite`, and `generate` functions all take and return a state dictionary, ensuring that information is carried over between steps.


**Overall Score for Extract Rubric Method:** 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 marks**

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Rubric Parsing:**  Implement a mechanism to intelligently parse the rubric and extract relevant grading criteria and their weights.  This could involve using another LLM to process the rubric, regular expressions, or a dedicated rubric parsing library. The output should be structured data (e.g., a dictionary) that can be easily incorporated into the grading prompt.

2. **Prompt Engineering:** Improve the prompt to handle longer documents. Use techniques like summarization, keyword extraction, or splitting the documents into smaller, manageable chunks before incorporating them into the prompt. The prompt should also clearly guide the LLM on how to use the structured rubric data for grading.

3. **Comprehensive Output Parsing:** Enhance the output parsing to extract a more detailed evaluation that goes beyond a simple "yes/no" or numerical score. The LLM should provide a breakdown of points earned or lost based on specific criteria, allowing for more insightful feedback.

4. **Error Handling:** The code lacks error handling. It should include checks for LLM errors, network issues, and file processing problems.  Proper error handling improves robustness.

5. **Code Clarity:** Some variable names are not very descriptive (e.g., `docs`). More descriptive names would improve readability.


By addressing these improvements, the code can achieve a much higher score on the rubric and become a more effective and robust program grading system.


This Jupyter Notebook attempts to build a system for grading Java programs using Langchain, vector databases, and LLMs.  However, the code has several significant issues preventing it from functioning correctly as intended.  Let's break down the problems and suggest improvements.

**Major Issues:**

1. **Incorrect Web Scraping:** The `WebBaseLoader` is attempting to load Markdown files (`rubric.md`, `model_solution.md`, `student_solution.md`) from a GitHub repository using URLs that point to the GitHub *rendered* page, not the raw file content.  This means the loaded content includes all the GitHub HTML and UI elements, not just the Markdown text.  The correct URLs should point to the raw files (e.g.,  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kudhru/m24-llm-midsem/main/data/real-world-scenario/rubric.md`).

2. **Missing or Incorrect Imports:** Several crucial imports are missing or incorrect:

   * `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` is not a standard Langchain import.  You likely need to install a specific Google AI library and import it correctly.
   * You're missing the import for `getpass`.  Though it's used, the error isn't directly apparent because the code only runs if `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is *not* already set in the environment.

3. **`GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` and Model Path:** The use of  `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")` is problematic.  `models/embedding-001` suggests a locally stored model, which is unusual for this type of embedding.  Google's Generative AI embeddings are typically accessed via API keys.  The code needs to be revised to use the API key correctly.

4. **Incomplete and Incorrect Grading Logic:** The `grade_documents` function is incomplete and contains logical errors:

   * It tries to use a `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (which is not defined), not `ChatOpenAI`.
   * The `scored_result.binary_score` is expected to be "yes" or "no" to determine relevance; however, that's not how a grading score would work. A numeric score (out of 100) is needed.
   * The logic for determining whether to proceed with generation or rewriting is not based on a reasonable grading metric.

5. **Inconsistent LLM Usage:** The code switches between `ChatOpenAI` and an undefined `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.  Choose a single LLM provider and stick with it.


**Rubric Evaluation (Based on your provided rubric):**

Given the significant errors above, a proper evaluation is impossible.  Let's assign scores based on what *could* work if the code were fixed:

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt *idea* is good, aiming to include the rubric, model solution, and student solution. However, the current implementation fails to load the files correctly, so it gets a **1 mark**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (0 marks):** The output parsing is incomplete and incorrect (due to the faulty `grade_documents` function).  It receives **0 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The notebook demonstrates an understanding of state management using `TypedDict`, so it gets **1 mark**.

**Total Score: 2 / 6**


**Recommended Improvements:**

1. **Fix Web Loading:** Use the raw GitHub URLs.
2. **Correct Imports:** Ensure all necessary libraries are installed and imported correctly.  Use a consistent LLM (e.g., `ChatOpenAI`).
3. **Implement Google AI Embeddings (if desired):** Properly set up and use the Google Generative AI embeddings with your API key.
4. **Rewrite `grade_documents`:**  Design a grading function that uses the LLM to compare the student's code to the model solution and the rubric, producing a numeric score (0-100).  This should not be a binary ("yes"/"no") decision about relevance.
5. **Refine Agent Logic:** The agent's decision-making should be driven by the actual grading score, not a binary "relevance" check.
6. **Choose a Single LLM:** Avoid switching between different LLMs in different parts of the code.

Once these fixes are made, the evaluation can be properly rerun, and the rubric score will reflect the actual functionality.  Remember to handle potential errors during file loading and LLM interaction gracefully.


This notebook demonstrates a complex Langchain application for grading Java programs.  However, it's incomplete and contains several issues preventing a proper evaluation according to the provided rubric.  Let's break down the problems and how to address them to achieve a score of 6/6 on the Review Evaluation Method.


**Problems & Solutions:**

1. **Data Loading:** The notebook attempts to load Markdown files from GitHub URLs using `WebBaseLoader`.  This approach is problematic because it downloads the entire GitHub page, including unrelated HTML elements, resulting in noisy and inaccurate document content.

   * **Solution:**  Use a more robust loader specifically designed for Markdown files, such as `MarkdownLoader`.  Alternatively, download the files beforehand and load them locally, which is generally more reliable and efficient.


2. **Prompt Design (0/3):** The `grade_documents` function has a critical flaw. It's using a prompt that directly attempts to compare and grade the student's solution against the model solution and rubric *without any intermediate steps to extract relevant information*.  This is likely to fail or produce inaccurate results.  The prompt is also missing crucial information about how the grading should be conducted and what aspects of the code should be evaluated (according to the rubric).

   * **Solution:**  The prompt needs a significant overhaul. It should:
      * **Clearly define the grading criteria:**  Explicitly reference the rubric sections relevant to the grading process.
      * **Structured Output:** The prompt should guide the LLM to provide structured feedback—for example, scores for individual rubric criteria and justifications.
      * **Steps:** Break down the grading process into smaller, more manageable tasks.  The LLM should first identify relevant code sections, then compare them against the model solution based on the rubric's criteria, and finally provide a score.  This might involve multiple LLM calls.


3. **Parsing/Output Extraction (0/2):** The code assumes the LLM's response will be a simple "yes" or "no" for relevance. This is far too simplistic for grading.

   * **Solution:** The output from the LLM needs to be parsed according to a structured format.  Since the improved prompt will use a structured format (like JSON or a similar key-value structure), the code must extract the relevant fields (e.g., scores for different criteria).   Libraries like `json` can be used for JSON parsing.


4. **State Saving (0/1):** The code doesn't explicitly save the reviewed evaluation. While the `AgentState` TypedDict is defined, it's not used effectively to maintain state across multiple iterations of the grading process.

   * **Solution:**  Integrate the `AgentState` properly.  After each grading step, the updated scores and LLM outputs should be added to the `messages` field of the `AgentState`.  This will require persisting the state between function calls (possibly using a database or file storage).


5. **Missing Code:** The `grade_documents` function references `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` which is not defined or imported in the provided code.


6. **Tool Usage:** The `tools` list contains retriever tools, but the `agent` function doesn't use them effectively within the prompt to guide the reasoning process. The retriever tools are intended to fetch the necessary information from the vector databases, allowing the LLM to make more informed decisions.


**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

The revised code would involve a more iterative process, perhaps using a state machine or similar pattern. Here's a simplified outline:

```python
# ... (Data loading with MarkdownLoader, vector database creation) ...

def grade_step(state, step_description):
    # Prepare prompt with relevant parts of the rubric, model solution, and student solution.
    prompt = construct_prompt(state, step_description)  # New function to create refined prompts

    llm_response = llm.invoke(prompt)  # LLM call with a structured output schema

    # Extract relevant data from the structured LLM response
    updated_state = update_state(state, llm_response) 
    return updated_state


initial_state = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Grade this Java code: ...")]}  # Initial state

# Iterative grading process:
state = grade_step(initial_state, "Initial Code Analysis")  # Analyze overall structure
state = grade_step(state, "Function Correctness")     # Check functions based on rubric
state = grade_step(state, "Code Style Evaluation")  # Check coding style from rubric
# ... and more steps as needed ...

final_grade = extract_final_grade(state)  # Extract the final grade from the accumulated state
print(final_grade)
# Save final_grade to a file or database
```

This revised approach addresses the prompt design, output parsing, and state saving issues.  Remember that the `construct_prompt` and `update_state` functions would contain the logic to create effective prompts and correctly update the agent's state, respectively.  The success of this depends heavily on creating well-defined prompts that break down the grading into smaller, more manageable subtasks.  You would need to iterate on the prompt design multiple times.


By implementing these changes, the notebook will come much closer to meeting the requirements of the rubric and achieving a higher score.  A complete implementation would require significantly more code and careful prompt engineering.


The provided code is a complex Langchain application designed to grade a student's Java program based on a rubric and a model solution.  The code is incomplete, and I cannot fully assess the "Marks Extraction Method" without the complete implementation of the `grade_documents` function and the context of how marks are actually represented in the rubric and extracted from the LLM response.  However, I can analyze the provided snippets and offer feedback based on what's present.

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt within the `grade_documents` function is partially complete.  It provides the student solution, rubric, and model solution to the LLM. However, it's crucial to:

    * **Specify the desired output format:** The prompt should explicitly instruct the LLM to output marks in a comma-separated format for each class mentioned in the rubric.  For example,  `Output marks for each class in a comma-separated string (Class1:mark1,Class2:mark2,...).`  Currently, it only asks for a score out of 100, which is insufficient for detailed marking based on a rubric.

    * **Handle potential class absences:** The rubric might have classes that don't appear in either solution. The prompt needs to address this, instructing the LLM to either assign a default mark (like 0) or to explicitly state the absence of the class in the output.

    * **Clarify the criteria:** The prompt could benefit from more precise instructions on how the LLM should compare the student's and model solutions against the rubric. Defining what constitutes a "correct" implementation for each class in the rubric will be very important.

    **Score: 1-2 marks (depending on how the missing specification details are handled in the full, missing code).**  The current prompt is insufficient for the task.


* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** This is completely missing.  The code receives a `binary_score` (yes/no) instead of comma-separated marks. There's no code to parse the LLM's response and extract individual marks for each class.  A proper implementation would involve using regular expressions or string manipulation techniques to parse the comma-separated string produced by the LLM.

    **Score: 0 marks**


* **State Saving (1 mark):**  The code shows some attempt at managing state using dictionaries, but there is no evidence of actually *saving* the extracted marks for the final calculation.  The `grade_documents` function returns "compare" or "mark" which doesn't store the extracted marks. A proper state saving mechanism would involve storing the extracted marks as part of the agent's state, possibly within the `AgentState` dictionary.

    **Score: 0 marks**


**Overall Score for Marks Extraction Method: 1-2 marks**

The provided code snippet demonstrates only a small part of the functionality needed to extract and process the marks.  To achieve a higher score, substantial improvements and additions are necessary in the prompt design, output parsing and state saving mechanisms.  The crucial missing piece is the full implementation of how the rubric and LLM output are used to extract marks.  Consider using libraries for more structured output from your LLM, and ensure the output is suitable for straightforward parsing.


The provided code implements a LangChain application for grading Java programs. Let's evaluate it against the rubric provided for Module 8, focusing on the Total Marks Calculation section.  The rubric doesn't actually define a `sum_marks` tool, which is a critical flaw in the rubric itself.  The code uses various LangChain components, but it doesn't directly perform a summation of marks as described in the rubric.  Therefore, a direct evaluation based on the rubric's criteria is impossible.

However, let's analyze what the code *does* and how it could be modified to meet the *spirit* of the rubric, even if not the letter.

**Issues and Improvements:**

1. **Missing `sum_marks` Tool:** The rubric's core requirement—using a `sum_marks` tool—is absent. The code needs a custom tool defined to calculate the total marks.  This tool would likely take individual class scores (or perhaps a structured representation of the grading) as input and return a total.

2. **Grading Logic:** The `grade_documents` function attempts grading, but its logic is rudimentary. It relies on an LLM to provide a binary ("yes" or "no") score instead of a detailed breakdown of marks per rubric criterion.  A more robust approach would involve:
   * A structured rubric representation (e.g., JSON) to map criteria to points.
   * A more sophisticated LLM prompt that extracts scores for each criterion based on the rubric and the student's code.
   * The `sum_marks` tool (once created) would then sum the individual criterion scores.


3. **Prompt Design (Rubric Item):**  The prompt within `grade_documents` is partially adequate but lacks the precision needed for automated marking.  It asks for an overall score without explicitly guiding the LLM on how to apply the rubric. It would receive a score of 2 out of 3.

4. **Parsing/Output Extraction (Rubric Item):** The code extracts the score, but only as a string ("yes" or "no").  For a true score summation, the output would need to be numerical scores for each rubric category, which would allow correct extraction of individual and total marks. It would receive a score of 0 out of 2.


5. **State Saving (Rubric Item):** The code saves state, but it's not clear how the final total score would be accessed and saved persistently. A more robust state management system would ensure the calculated total marks are preserved even across multiple sessions or code executions. It would receive a score of 0 out of 1.



**Suggested Code Modification (Illustrative):**

This example shows a skeletal improvement.  A complete solution would require a more detailed rubric and a more carefully crafted prompt.

```python
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

# ... (Existing code) ...

def sum_marks(marks_per_criterion: Dict[str, int]) -> int:
    """Sums marks from a dictionary of criterion scores."""
    return sum(marks_per_criterion.values())


def grade_documents(state) -> Tuple[Dict[str, int], int]: #Modified to return a dict and total score.
    # ... (Improved LLM prompt to extract scores per criterion from rubric and student solution) ...

    #Example: Assuming scores per criterion are extracted into `criterion_scores`
    criterion_scores = {
        "Correctness": 80, 
        "Efficiency": 15, 
        "Readability": 5
    }

    total_score = sum_marks(criterion_scores)
    return criterion_scores, total_score  # Return both the breakdown and total


# ... (Rest of the code, modified to handle the structured output) ...

#Example use within agent function:
criterion_scores, total_score = grade_documents(state) # call the modified function.
#Save or process the `total_score` and `criterion_scores` as needed

```

**Conclusion:**

The provided code is a good starting point, but significant modifications are needed to meet the requirements implied (though not explicitly stated) by the "Total Marks Calculation" section of the rubric.  The primary missing component is a proper `sum_marks` tool and a more structured approach to grading that goes beyond a simple binary "yes/no" assessment.  The rubric itself should be revised to clearly define the expected input and output format for the mark summation.


The provided Jupyter Notebook code implements a LangChain application for grading Java programs.  Let's analyze it according to the rubric you provided.  The rubric focuses on *graph construction*, which is missing from the code entirely.  The code defines several functions that could be *nodes* in a LangGraph, but there's no actual graph structure built using a LangGraph library.


**Rubric Assessment:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks): 0 marks**  The code doesn't create a LangGraph.  The functions `grade_documents`, `agent`, `rewrite`, and `generate` represent potential nodes, but are not integrated into a graph structure.

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks): 0 marks**  Since there's no graph, there are no edges. The control flow between the functions (`grade_documents` output directing to `generate` or `rewrite`, etc.) would define the edges, but this isn't formally represented using LangGraph.

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks): 0 marks**  No graph is compiled.


**How to improve the code to meet the rubric:**

To achieve a score on this rubric, you'll need to use a LangGraph library (like the one provided by `langgraph`).  Here's a skeletal example of how to structure the code to create a LangGraph:

```python
from langgraph import LangGraph

# ... (your existing functions: grade_documents, agent, rewrite, generate) ...

graph = LangGraph()

# Add nodes (your functions)
graph.add_node("agent", agent)
graph.add_node("grade_documents", grade_documents)
graph.add_node("rewrite", rewrite)
graph.add_node("generate", generate)


# Add edges to define the workflow (example)
graph.add_edge("agent", "grade_documents", condition=lambda state: True) #Agent always goes to grade_documents
graph.add_edge("grade_documents", "generate", condition=lambda state: grade_documents(state) == "generate")
graph.add_edge("grade_documents", "rewrite", condition=lambda state: grade_documents(state) == "rewrite")
graph.add_edge("rewrite", "agent", condition=lambda state: True) #Rewrite always goes back to the agent
graph.add_edge("generate", "end", condition=lambda state: True) #Generate ends the process

# Compile the graph
compiled_graph = graph.compile()

# Run the graph (starting node)
initial_state = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Evaluate this Java code: ...")]} #example of input
final_state = compiled_graph.run("agent", initial_state)

print(final_state)
```

This revised structure explicitly creates a LangGraph, adds nodes (your functions), defines edges using conditions based on the output of `grade_documents`, and then compiles and runs the graph.  Remember to replace `"Evaluate this Java code: ..."` with your actual initial input and adapt conditions as needed to reflect your logic.  You'll also need to install the `langgraph` package (`pip install langgraph`).  The existing code needs substantial modification to incorporate this graph-based execution.  The `condition` lambdas in `add_edge` determine the flow based on the return values of the functions. Remember to handle potential errors and exceptions in a production-ready application.


This Jupyter Notebook code attempts to build a system for grading Java programs using Langchain, embedding documents (rubric, model solution, student solution), and a Large Language Model (LLM).  However, there are several significant issues and areas for improvement.

**Problems and Errors:**

1. **`GOOGLE_API_KEY` Handling:** The code prompts for a Google API key, but it's unclear where this key is ultimately used.  The code uses `langchain_google_genai` which implies it's intended for Google's AI models, but the embeddings are later instantiated using  `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")`. This points to a local model, not a Google-hosted model, creating a mismatch.  Either use Google's hosted models (removing the local model path) or remove the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` handling entirely if using a different embedding model.

2. **Web Scraping Issues:** The `WebBaseLoader` attempts to load Markdown files from GitHub.  GitHub renders these files as HTML, including a lot of extraneous content (navigation bars, headers, footers, etc.). The loaded `page_content` contains all this extra HTML, which will likely confuse the LLM.  A more robust approach would be to directly download the raw Markdown files or use a specialized library that can parse GitHub's rendered HTML more effectively.  Alternatively, if you have the `.md` files locally, directly load them using `FileSystemDocumentLoader`.

3. **Embedding Model:** `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings(model="models/embedding-001")` suggests a local embedding model.  This path isn't standard and needs clarification.  Is this model actually present?  If not, it will cause errors. Specify the correct path or use a readily available embedding model (e.g., OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings).

4. **`ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` Import:**  The `grade_documents` function uses `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, which is not a standard Langchain class. There is no readily available `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` within Langchain.  You need to either use `ChatOpenAI` or another suitable LLM class that integrates with your embedding model.

5. **`grade_documents` Logic:** The `grade_documents` function's logic is flawed. It checks if `score == "yes"` which is probably a misinterpretation of a potential LLM output. The LLM should provide a numerical score (out of 100), not a binary "yes/no."  The logic needs to be rewritten to handle the expected numerical score from the LLM.

6. **Inconsistent LLM usage:** The `agent` function uses `ChatOpenAI`, while `grade_documents` (as written) uses the undefined `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`.  Maintain consistency in LLM choices.

7. **`rewrite` function:** This function uses GPT-4 for rephrasing the question, but the prompt construction could be more precise and effective. It might be helpful to provide examples of good and bad questions or further guide the LLM on what constitutes a better question for this specific grading task.

8. **Missing `student_sol_documents` processing:** The notebook shows the loading of `student_sol_documents`, but it's not included in the vectorstore creation or in the tools used in the LLM chain. This is a critical omission as it's the core data that needs to be assessed.


**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

This improved structure addresses many of the issues, but you still need to replace placeholder comments with correct API keys, model names, and file paths.

```python
import os
from langchain.document_loaders import FileSystemDocumentLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings  # Or another suitable embedding model
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI # or another suitable LLM
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.tools import Tool

# Load documents (assuming you have rubric.md, model_solution.md, student_solution.md locally)
loader = FileSystemDocumentLoader("./rubric.md")
rubric_docs = loader.load()
# ...similarly load model_sol_docs and student_sol_docs...

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
rubric = text_splitter.split_documents(rubric_docs)
# ...similarly split model_sol and student_sol...

# Embeddings (replace with your chosen embeddings)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

rubric_db = Chroma.from_documents(rubric, embeddings)
model_sol_db = Chroma.from_documents(model_sol, embeddings)
student_sol_db = Chroma.from_documents(student_sol, embeddings)

# Retriever tools (simplified)
rubric_retriever = rubric_db.as_retriever()
# ...similarly for model_sol_retriever and student_sol_retriever...

tools = [
    Tool(
        name="retrieve_rubric",
        func=rubric_retriever.get_relevant_documents,
        description="Useful for getting relevant parts of the rubric.",
    ),
    # ...similar tools for model_sol and student_sol...
]


# LLM (replace with your chosen LLM)
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

# Prompt template (needs significant improvement for clarity and effectiveness)
prompt_template = """
You are a grader assessing a Java program.  Here is the student's code:
{student_code}

Here is the rubric:
{rubric}

Here is the model solution:
{model_solution}

Grade the student's code according to the rubric and model solution. Provide a numerical score (0-100).  Explain your reasoning.
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=prompt_template, input_variables=["student_code", "rubric", "model_solution"])

# LLM chain
llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Grading function
def grade_program(student_code, rubric_docs, model_solution_docs):
    result = llm_chain.run(student_code=student_code, rubric=rubric_docs, model_solution=model_solution_docs)
    # Extract score and reasoning from the result (this requires careful parsing of LLM output)
    # ...parsing logic to extract score and reasoning...
    return score, reasoning

# Example usage
student_code =  """...student's Java code here..."""
score, reasoning = grade_program(student_code, rubric_docs, model_sol_docs)
print(f"Score: {score}, Reasoning: {reasoning}")

```

Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pip install langchain openai chromadb`  (and other relevant libraries as needed).  You will also need API keys for OpenAI or your chosen LLM and embedding provider.  The prompt engineering and output parsing are critical and require careful design to ensure accurate and reliable grading.  This revised structure provides a more robust foundation, but significant further work is required to achieve a functional and accurate program grading system.
