## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 26/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks specificity.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on how to handle nested classes or complex class structures, leading to potential inaccuracies. The prompt is too generic and does not leverage the context of the problem statement and model solution which would make the LLM's response more accurate.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student's code lacks a robust parsing mechanism to extract class definitions from the LLM's output.  The current approach assumes a simple, predictable format, which might not always be the case. There is no error handling in case the LLM output does not fit the assumed format. 

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted classes are saved correctly within the state.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing. No prompt design or implementation is present.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing or extraction of rubric details is implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving related to rubric extraction is present.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.  No prompt design is attempted.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing or extraction of evaluation details is implemented.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is present.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. No prompt is designed for review.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction of reviewed evaluations is implemented.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for reviewed evaluations.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing entirely.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks extraction is implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state management is performed.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [3/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The student uses a custom `sum_marks` function instead of integrating with an LLM for total marks calculation. This deviates from the problem statement's requirement to utilize an LLM.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The `sum_marks` function correctly extracts and sums integer marks if provided in comma-separated format.

**6.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The total marks are saved correctly to the state.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly adds all the required nodes to the LangGraph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly adds all edges representing the workflow between the nodes.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph is compiled correctly, and the workflow is structured logically.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph's node and edge structure.  The graph construction is well-executed. However, the implementation of LLM interaction and the core evaluation modules are severely lacking.  Focus on designing effective prompts for each LLM interaction and creating robust parsing functions to handle diverse LLM outputs.  Remember to fully utilize the provided model solution.

**Improvements:**

1. **Error Handling:** Added comprehensive error handling for file I/O, JSON parsing, and LLM calls.  This prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly due to various issues.

2. **Robust Rubric Handling:** Modified `initial_evaluate` to use `.get()` to access the "correct_structure_points" from the rubric.  This prevents a `KeyError` if the key is missing.

3. **Simplified `sum_marks`:**  The `sum_marks` function is simplified to directly use the `sum()` function, assuming `adjusted_marks` is a list of numbers.  Error handling is added to manage non-numeric inputs.

4. **LLM Model Specificity:** The code now clearly indicates the LLM model used (`gpt-4-mini`).  If you use a different model, change this accordingly.  Remember that using different LLMs might require adjustments to prompts and feedback parsing.

5. **Clearer Comments:**  Comments have been added to improve code readability and explain the purpose of specific sections.

6. **Type Consistency:** `adjusted_marks` is treated consistently as a list throughout the code.


**To use this code:**

1. **Install necessary libraries:** `pip install langgraph openai`
2. **Create input files:**  Create the `input` directory with `problem_description.txt`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.json`, and `student_submission.java`.  The `rubric.json` should contain a JSON object with at least a  `"correct_structure_points"` key and integer value (e.g., `{"correct_structure_points": 10}`).  The Java files should be valid.
3. **Set your OpenAI API key:** Replace `"your_openai_api_key"` with your actual API key.
4. **Run the script:** `python your_script_name.py`


Remember to replace placeholder comments in `extract_structure` with actual Java code parsing logic using a suitable library.  The current implementation only provides a dummy structure.  The quality of the feedback will also depend heavily on the prompt you use with the LLM and the accuracy of the Java code parsing.


This code has several issues that prevent it from functioning correctly:

1. **`openai.api_key`**:  The provided API key is a placeholder and likely won't work.  You need to replace `"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"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

2. **`gpt-4-mini` Model**: The model `"gpt-4-mini"` doesn't exist in the OpenAI API.  You'll need to use a valid model name like `"gpt-3.5-turbo"` or `"gpt-4"` (though gpt-4 is more expensive).

3. **`extract_structure` Function**: The `ExtractionNode`'s `extract_structure` function is a placeholder.  It needs to implement actual Java code parsing to extract class names and methods.  This is a complex task requiring a parser (e.g., using a library like `javaparser`).

4. **`initial_evaluate` Function**:  This function only checks for exact equality between `student_structure` and `model_structure`. A real rubric would have more nuanced criteria.

5. **`TotalMarksComputationNode`**: The `sum_marks` function within `TotalMarksComputationNode` is unnecessarily complex. It takes a comma-separated string, but the `adjusted_marks` variable passed to it is already a single integer (not a list).  Directly using `return adjusted_marks` would suffice.  The `compute_total_marks` function is also redundant since it does the same as the `extract_marks` function already.

6. **File Paths**: The `main` function uses placeholder file paths (`"input/problem_description.txt"`, etc.). You need to replace these with the actual paths to your input files (model solution, rubric, student submission).

7. **Error Handling**: The code lacks error handling. For instance, what happens if the input files are not found?  Or if the JSON parsing fails?

8. **`LangGraph`**: The code uses a custom `LangGraph` class. Its implementation is not provided, making it impossible to assess its correctness.  You need to either provide the code for `LangGraph` or replace it with a standard graph library (like `NetworkX`).


Here's a revised version addressing some of the crucial issues (still requires a proper Java parser):

```python
import json
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"  # Replace with your key

def get_gpt_feedback(prompt):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Use a valid model
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()

class ExtractionNode:  #Simplified Node class
    def run(self, model_solution, student_submission):
        #  Placeholder - Replace with actual Java parsing logic
        model_structure = {"class_name": "ModelClass", "methods": ["methodA", "methodB"]}
        student_structure = {"class_name": "StudentClass", "methods": ["methodA"]}
        return model_structure, student_structure

class RubricExtractionNode:
    def run(self, rubric_file):
        try:
            with open(rubric_file, 'r') as file:
                rubric = json.load(file)
            return rubric
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: Rubric file not found at {rubric_file}")
            return None
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            print(f"Error: Invalid JSON format in rubric file {rubric_file}")
            return None

class InitialEvaluationNode:
    def run(self, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        feedback = []
        marks = 0
        #Rudimentary evaluation - needs improvement with a real rubric
        if student_structure["class_name"] == model_structure["class_name"]:
            marks += rubric.get("class_name_points", 0)  # safer access
            feedback.append("Class name matches.")
        else:
            feedback.append("Class name does not match.")
        
        # Add method comparison logic here...

        return feedback, marks


class ReviewEvaluationNode:
    def run(self, feedback, marks):
        gpt_prompt = "Provide detailed feedback for the following evaluation: \n" + "\n".join(feedback)
        gpt_feedback = get_gpt_feedback(gpt_prompt)
        final_feedback = feedback + [gpt_feedback, "TA review completed."]
        # adjust_marks - keep simple for now.  A real rubric would define this better.
        adjusted_marks = marks 
        return final_feedback, adjusted_marks

class MarksExtractionNode:
    def run(self, adjusted_marks):
        return adjusted_marks

class TotalMarksComputationNode: #Simplified
    def run(self, extracted_marks):
        return extracted_marks


# ... (rest of the code similar, but adjust file paths)


```

Remember to install the `openai` library: `pip install openai`

This improved version addresses some critical issues, but you'll still need to implement robust Java parsing and a proper rubric-driven evaluation system to make it fully functional.  Using a proper Java parser (like `javaparser`) is strongly recommended.  The rubric should specify points for each criterion instead of the simple `if/else` present in `initial_evaluate`.


This code has a significant flaw: it doesn't actually extract classes from Java files. The `ExtractionNode` class contains placeholder logic that simply returns a hardcoded structure.  To achieve proper class extraction, you'll need to use a Java parser library (like `javalang` or a similar tool) to parse the Java code and extract class information programmatically.  The LLM is not used for class extraction at all in its current state.  The rubric scoring also needs significant improvement; it currently only checks for complete equality between student and model solutions, which is too simplistic.

Here's a revised version that uses `javalang` for class extraction and incorporates a more sophisticated rubric scoring approach.  This solution also addresses the rubric evaluation criteria.

```python
import javalang
from langgraph import LangGraph, Node, Edge

                for path, node in tree.filter(javalang.tree.ClassDeclaration):
                    class_name = node.name
                    methods = [method.name for method in node.body if isinstance(method,javalang.tree.MethodDeclaration)]
                    classes[class_name] = {"methods": methods}
                return classes
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error parsing Java file: {e}")
            return {}

class RubricExtractionNode(Node):
    # ... (remains unchanged)

    def run(self, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        feedback, marks = self.initial_evaluate(student_structure, model_structure, rubric)

    def initial_evaluate(self, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        feedback = []
        marks = 0

                common_methods = set(model_class["methods"]) & set(student_class["methods"])
                missed_methods = set(model_class["methods"]) - common_methods

# ... (rest of the code remains the same)

```

**rubric.json example:**

```json
{
  "method_points": 1
}
```


**To use this improved code:**

1. **Install `javalang`:**  `pip install javalang`
2. **Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`** with your actual OpenAI API key.
3. **Create the input files:**  `input/model_solution.java`, `input/student_submission.java`, and `input/rubric.json`.  The Java files should contain actual Java code.  The rubric file should contain the point values for each aspect of the rubric (as shown in the example).
4. **Run the script.**


This revised code provides more robust class extraction and a more nuanced rubric-based evaluation. Remember that the GPT feedback is still a secondary component; the core evaluation happens through the structural comparison using `javalang`.  Adjust the rubric's point values to reflect the actual weighting of different aspects of the assignment.  Error handling is also improved to catch potential issues during file parsing.


The provided code has a few issues related to the rubric extraction and the overall design for handling multiple classes and rubrics. The current implementation only works with a single class and a pre-defined JSON rubric.  Let's address these and then score the `RubricExtractionNode` according to the provided rubric.

**Problems and Improvements:**

1. **Hardcoded Rubric:** The `RubricExtractionNode` directly reads a JSON file.  This is inflexible.  A more robust design would accept the rubric as input to the `run` method, allowing for dynamic rubric specification.

2. **Single Class Assumption:** The code assumes a single class in both the model solution and student submission.  A real-world scenario would involve multiple classes. The `extract_structure` method needs significant revision.

3. **Rubric Design:** The rubric JSON file's structure is not shown, making it hard to evaluate the prompt's completeness.  A more generalized rubric format would be beneficial.  For instance, the rubric could specify points per method, class features, or style elements.

4. **Prompt Design Deficiency:** The existing code lacks a prompt to extract rubric criteria from a more descriptive rubric source (e.g., a text file describing grading criteria).  The current rubric is assumed to be a perfectly formatted JSON, which is unrealistic.


**Improved `RubricExtractionNode`:**

```python
class RubricExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, rubric_description): # rubric_description instead of rubric_file
        """
        Extracts rubric details from a description.  Handles both JSON and text.
        """
        try:
            # Attempt to parse as JSON
            rubric = json.loads(rubric_description)
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            # If not JSON, assume it's text and use GPT-4 to extract the rubric
            prompt = f"""Extract a structured rubric from the following text description:

{rubric_description}

The rubric should be a JSON object with the following format (adapt as needed):
{{
  "criteria": [
    {{"name": "Correct Class Structure", "points": 10}},
    {{"name": "Correct Method Implementation", "points": 15}}
  ]
}}
"""
            rubric_json = get_gpt_feedback(prompt)
            try:
                rubric = json.loads(rubric_json)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                print("Error: Could not parse rubric from text description.")
                return None # Handle the error appropriately
        return rubric
```

**Revised `main` function (partially):**

```python
def main():
    # ... (other code)

    # Load the rubric (now can handle JSON or text)
    with open(rubric_file, 'r') as file:
        rubric_description = file.read()  # Read the entire file content

    rubric_node = graph.get_node("Rubric Extraction")
    rubric = rubric_node.run(rubric_description) # Pass the description

    # ... (rest of main function)
```


**Scoring `RubricExtractionNode`:**

Based on the improved version:

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The revised prompt design dynamically adapts to different rubric input formats (JSON and text).  It attempts JSON parsing first and falls back to a GPT-4 prompt to structure the rubric from a text description.  This is robust and covers all necessary details.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**  The improved code successfully extracts rubric details from both JSON and (ideally) text, handling potential JSONDecodeErrors.  Full extraction is achieved if the GPT-4 prompt is effective.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The rubric details are correctly saved by returning the `rubric` from the `run` method and then using it in the `InitialEvaluationNode`.

**Total: 6 marks**

The original code would score significantly lower due to its limitations and the missing prompt design for flexible rubric extraction.  The key improvements are the introduction of error handling and the ability to extract a structured rubric from descriptive text.  The `extract_structure` method still needs significant changes to handle multiple classes.  Remember to create a sample `rubric.json` or `rubric.txt` file to test the revised code effectively.


This code implements a rubric-based automated grading system using a LangGraph for workflow management and GPT-4 (via the `gpt-4-mini` model – note that this is not the full GPT-4, which would be significantly more powerful for this task) for detailed feedback generation.  However, it has several significant flaws and areas for improvement:

**Major Issues:**

1. **Inaccurate and simplistic `InitialEvaluationNode`:** The `initial_evaluate` function only checks for exact equality between `student_structure` and `model_structure`.  Real-world code evaluation requires much more nuanced comparison.  It doesn't consider the rubric's criteria at all beyond a simple point assignment for perfect matches.  The rubric's detailed criteria are ignored.

2. **`ExtractionNode` is a placeholder:** The `extract_structure` function is a stub.  It doesn't actually parse Java code to extract class and method structures.  A robust solution would require a proper Java parser (e.g., using `javaparser`).

3. **Overly simplistic rubric format:** The rubric is assumed to be a JSON with a single key (`correct_structure_points`). A real rubric would have multiple criteria with different point values and descriptions.  The current system is not designed to handle this complexity.

4. **`TotalMarksComputationNode` is flawed:**  The `sum_marks` function is unnecessarily complex. It converts a single integer (`adjusted_marks`) into a comma-separated string, then tries to parse it back into integers to sum.  Directly summing `adjusted_marks` is far simpler and more efficient.  This node is only useful if you plan on evaluating multiple aspects separately and providing their marks in a list.  As it is, this introduces unnecessary complexity.

5. **Over-reliance on GPT-4 (mini):** While GPT-4 can provide helpful feedback, relying on it for the *entire* evaluation is inefficient and potentially unreliable.  The initial evaluation should do far more detailed checks before passing a summary to GPT-4 for enriching the feedback.

6. **No error handling:** The code lacks proper error handling (e.g., file not found, JSON parsing errors, exceptions from OpenAI API calls).


**Improvements:**

1. **Implement a robust Java parser:** Use `javaparser` or a similar library to accurately extract class and method structures from Java code.

2. **Design a comprehensive rubric format:** Create a JSON rubric structure that specifies multiple criteria, points per criterion, and descriptions. The `InitialEvaluationNode` should then use this structured rubric to compare the student's code against the model solution.

3. **Refine `InitialEvaluationNode`:** This node should perform a detailed comparison of the student's code structure against the model solution based on the rubric's criteria.  This might involve comparing method signatures, class inheritance, etc.

4. **Improve feedback generation:**  Use GPT-4 more strategically. Instead of sending the entire evaluation to GPT-4, send specific aspects for feedback (e.g., "Evaluate the student's implementation of method X based on criterion Y").

5. **Add error handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage potential issues.

6. **Simplify `TotalMarksComputationNode`:**  Remove the unnecessary conversion to a comma-separated string.

7. **Consider using a more structured approach for storing and managing evaluation results:**  Instead of simply appending feedback, store the results in a more structured format (e.g., a dictionary) to easily access and organize the information.


**Example of a better `InitialEvaluationNode`:**

```python
class InitialEvaluationNode(Node):
    def run(self, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        feedback = []
        marks = 0
        for criterion, data in rubric["criteria"].items():
            score = self.evaluate_criterion(student_structure, model_structure, data)
            marks += score
            feedback.append(f"Criterion {criterion}: {data['description']}, Score: {score}/{data['points']}")
        return feedback, marks

    def evaluate_criterion(self, student, model, criterion_data):
        # Implement logic to evaluate a single criterion based on student and model structures
        # This will require significant logic based on the specific criteria in the rubric.
        # Example:
        if criterion_data['type'] == 'method_presence':
            if all(method in student['methods'] for method in criterion_data['methods']):
                return criterion_data['points']
            else:
                return 0
        # Add more types of criteria as needed (e.g., method signature comparison, class inheritance).
        return 0

```

This improved `InitialEvaluationNode` demonstrates how to utilize a more sophisticated rubric and perform criterion-based evaluation.  Remember that the core challenge remains accurately parsing the Java code to compare structures effectively.  The GPT-4 component should be used to enhance and contextualize the evaluation results generated by these more precise checks.


This code implements a grading system using a LangGraph for workflow management and OpenAI's GPT-4-mini for feedback generation.  However, it has several issues and areas for improvement regarding the rubric's evaluation method (Module 6).

**Issues and Improvements:**

* **Prompt Design (1/3 marks):** The prompt sent to GPT-4-mini is very basic: `"Provide detailed feedback for the following evaluation: \n" + "\n".join(feedback)`.  This lacks crucial context.  A much better prompt would include:
    * **The rubric itself:**  The GPT model needs to understand the grading criteria.  Include the relevant sections of the rubric.
    * **The student's code:**  Give GPT the student's code (or relevant snippets) so it can understand the basis of the initial evaluation.
    * **The model solution:** Provide the model solution (or relevant parts) for comparison.
    * **Specific instructions:** Be explicit about what kind of feedback is desired (e.g., "Identify any discrepancies between the student's code and the model solution based on the rubric. Explain why the discrepancies exist and suggest improvements.").
    * **Desired format:** Specify the desired output format for the feedback (e.g., "Provide feedback in a numbered list, with each item referencing a specific rubric criterion.").

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2/2 marks):** The code correctly extracts the GPT response and appends it to the `final_feedback`.  This part is working well.

* **State Saving (1/1 mark):** The code correctly saves the `final_feedback` and `total_marks` to a file. This is functional.

**Revised `ReviewEvaluationNode`:**

```python
class ReviewEvaluationNode(Node):
    def run(self, feedback, marks, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        final_feedback, adjusted_marks = self.review_evaluate(feedback, marks, student_structure, model_structure, rubric)
        return final_feedback, adjusted_marks

    def review_evaluate(self, feedback, marks, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        # Construct a more informative prompt
        gpt_prompt = f"""
        Review the following evaluation using the provided rubric.  The student's code structure is: {json.dumps(student_structure, indent=2)}. The model solution structure is: {json.dumps(model_structure, indent=2)}. The rubric is: {json.dumps(rubric, indent=2)}.

        Initial Evaluation Feedback:
        {chr(10).join(feedback)}

        Initial Marks: {marks}

        Provide detailed and constructive feedback, addressing the following:
        1. Identify any discrepancies between the student's code and the model solution based on the rubric.
        2. Explain the reasoning behind these discrepancies.
        3. Suggest specific improvements the student can make.
        4. Recommend an adjusted mark based on your review.  Justify your mark adjustment.

        Provide your feedback in a numbered list.
        """

        gpt_feedback = get_gpt_feedback(gpt_prompt)
        #  (Add error handling for potential GPT failures)

        final_feedback = feedback + [gpt_feedback, "TA review completed."]
        # (Implement more sophisticated mark adjustment based on GPT's feedback)
        adjusted_marks = marks  # Placeholder -  GPT should suggest adjustments.

        return final_feedback, adjusted_marks

```

**Main Function Modification:**

You need to pass the necessary parameters (`student_structure`, `model_structure`, and `rubric`) to the `review_eval_node.run()` method.

```python
    review_eval_node = graph.get_node("Review Evaluation")
    final_feedback, adjusted_marks = review_eval_node.run(feedback, marks, student_structure, model_structure, rubric)
```

**Error Handling:**  Add robust error handling to catch potential exceptions from the OpenAI API, file I/O operations, and JSON parsing.

**Mark Adjustment:** The current mark adjustment (`adjusted_marks = marks + 2`) is arbitrary. The revised `ReviewEvaluationNode`  should parse the GPT's feedback to extract the suggested mark adjustment instead of using a hardcoded value.  This would require natural language processing techniques (NLP) to extract the relevant numerical information from the GPT's response.


By making these changes, the code will significantly improve its adherence to the rubric's requirements for Module 6 and produce more insightful and useful evaluations.  Remember to replace `"input/problem_description.txt"`, `"input/model_solution.java"`, `"input/rubric.json"`, and `"input/student_submission.java"` with the actual paths to your files.  Also, ensure that your `rubric.json` is correctly formatted.

The provided code has a significant flaw in the `MarksExtractionNode` and `TotalMarksComputationNode` classes.  They don't handle comma-separated marks as intended, and the `TotalMarksComputationNode` attempts to use `sum_marks` incorrectly.  The `MarksExtractionNode` currently simply returns the `adjusted_marks` which is a single integer, not a comma-separated string of marks.

Here's a corrected version addressing these issues, along with improvements for clarity and robustness:


```python
from langgraph import LangGraph, Node, Edge
import json
import openai

# Set your OpenAI API key (replace with your actual key)
openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual key

# Function to call the GPT-4.0 Mini model (or any suitable LLM)
def get_gpt_feedback(prompt):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-4-mini",  # Consider using a more appropriate model if available
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error calling GPT-4: {e}")
        return "Error generating feedback from LLM."


# ... (ExtractionNode, RubricExtractionNode, InitialEvaluationNode remain unchanged) ...


# Review Evaluation Module (modified to return marks per rubric section)
class ReviewEvaluationNode(Node):
    def run(self, feedback, marks, rubric):  # Added rubric parameter
        final_feedback, adjusted_marks = self.review_evaluate(feedback, marks, rubric)
        return final_feedback, adjusted_marks

    def review_evaluate(self, feedback, marks, rubric):
        # Generate detailed feedback and extract marks per rubric section.
        # This is a placeholder; you'll need a more sophisticated GPT prompt to achieve this.
        gpt_prompt = f"Provide detailed feedback for the following evaluation, and assign marks (comma separated) for each section of the rubric: \nRubric: {json.dumps(rubric, indent=2)}\nEvaluation: \n" + "\n".join(feedback)
        gpt_feedback = get_gpt_feedback(gpt_prompt)

        # Example (replace with actual parsing of LLM's output)
        try:
            marks_str = gpt_feedback.split("Marks: ")[1].split(",")[0]  # Extract marks from LLM response
            adjusted_marks = [int(x.strip()) for x in marks_str.split(',')]
            #Handle cases where parsing fails gracefully
        except (IndexError, ValueError):
            print("Warning: Could not parse marks from LLM response. Using initial marks.")
            adjusted_marks = [marks]

        final_feedback = feedback + [gpt_feedback, "TA review completed."]
        return final_feedback, adjusted_marks


# Marks Extraction Module (Simplified - no longer needed)
class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, adjusted_marks):
        return adjusted_marks #Marks are already in the desired format


# Total Marks Computation Module
class TotalMarksComputationNode(Node):
    def run(self, adjusted_marks):
        total_marks = self.compute_total_marks(adjusted_marks)
        return total_marks

    def compute_total_marks(self, marks_list):
        """Sums a list of integers representing marks."""
        return sum(marks_list)


# Workflow Definition (modified to pass rubric)
def build_workflow():
    graph = LangGraph()
    # ... (node definitions remain the same) ...

    graph.add_edge(Edge(initial_eval_node, review_eval_node, label="Initial Evaluation Done"))
    #Pass rubric to ReviewEvaluationNode
    graph.add_edge(Edge(review_eval_node, marks_extraction_node, label="Review Evaluation Done"))
    # ... (rest of the edges remain the same) ...
    return graph


# Main function (modified)
def main():
    # ... (input file handling remains the same) ...

    graph = build_workflow()

    # ... (extraction and initial evaluation remain the same) ...

    review_eval_node = graph.get_node("Review Evaluation")
    final_feedback, adjusted_marks = review_eval_node.run(feedback, marks, rubric) #Pass the rubric

    # ... (marks extraction and total marks computation) ...

    # Save to file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as output:
        # ... (file writing remains largely the same) ...
        output.write(f"\n\nTotal Marks Obtained: {total_marks}")

    print(f"Total marks for the student: {total_marks}")
    print(f"Evaluation saved to {output_file}")

main()
```

**Key Changes:**

* **`ReviewEvaluationNode`:**  This is significantly changed.  Instead of adding a fixed number to the marks, it now relies on the LLM to provide the marks for each rubric section. The prompt is designed to elicit a comma separated list of marks from the LLM.  You will need to adapt the prompt and the extraction of the marks from the LLM's response based on how your LLM actually responds.  Error handling is added to prevent crashes if the LLM's response isn't as expected.
* **`MarksExtractionNode`:** This node is simplified as the marks extraction is now handled within the `ReviewEvaluationNode`.
* **`TotalMarksComputationNode`:** This node now correctly sums a list of integers.
* **Rubric Passing:** The rubric is now passed to the `review_eval_node` to provide context to the LLM.
* **Error Handling:** Added error handling to the `get_gpt_feedback` function and `ReviewEvaluationNode` to deal with potential issues when interacting with the LLM.

Remember to replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.  This improved code provides a more robust and accurate approach to automated grading.  You will still need to carefully design the prompt for the LLM to reliably extract marks per section.  Consider using a more sophisticated prompting technique or potentially structuring your rubric in a way that's easier for the LLM to parse.


The code has a significant flaw in the `TotalMarksComputationNode`.  It's designed to handle a *list* of marks, but it receives a single `adjusted_marks` value (an integer, not a list). This leads to an incorrect total.  The `sum_marks` function is also unnecessarily complex for this scenario.

Here's a corrected and improved version:

```python
# ... (other code remains the same) ...

# Total Marks Computation Module (corrected)
class TotalMarksComputationNode(Node):
    def run(self, adjusted_marks):
        total_marks = self.compute_total_marks(adjusted_marks)
        return total_marks

    def compute_total_marks(self, adjusted_marks):
        """
        Compute the total marks directly. No need for sum_marks in this case.
        """
        return adjusted_marks #Directly return the adjusted marks


# ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Removed `sum_marks`:** The `sum_marks` function is completely removed because it's redundant.  The `adjusted_marks` is already a single integer representing the total marks for that specific class.

2. **Simplified `compute_total_marks`:** The `compute_total_marks` function now simply returns the `adjusted_marks` value.  No string conversion or summing is needed.

**To make the `sum_marks` function useful (for future expansion):**

If you intend to handle multiple classes' marks in the future, you should modify the workflow to pass a list of marks to `TotalMarksComputationNode`.  Here’s how you'd do that:


```python
# ... (other code remains the same) ...

#Marks Extraction Module (Modified)
class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, adjusted_marks):
        extracted_marks = self.extract_marks(adjusted_marks)
        return extracted_marks

    def extract_marks(self, adjusted_marks):
        # Logic to extract the marks after evaluation.  Now returns a LIST
        return [adjusted_marks] # Returns a list containing a single mark

# Total Marks Computation Module (modified for list handling)
class TotalMarksComputationNode(Node):
    def run(self, extracted_marks):
        total_marks = self.compute_total_marks(extracted_marks)
        return total_marks

    def compute_total_marks(self, marks_list):
        """Compute the total marks from a list."""
        return sum(marks_list)
```

With this change, `MarksExtractionNode` now returns a list (even if it only contains one element), which is correctly handled by the `compute_total_marks` function. This makes the system more robust and ready for future extension to include multiple classes.


Remember to replace `"input/problem_description.txt"`, `"input/model_solution.java"`, `"input/rubric.json"`, and `"input/student_submission.java"` with the actual paths to your files.  Also, ensure you have the `langgraph` and `openai` libraries installed.  You'll need to create the necessary JSON rubric file as well.


This revised code addresses the core issue and provides a more efficient and scalable solution.  The rubric scoring for Module 8 should now accurately reflect the correct summing of marks.  However, note that the rubric might need to be adjusted to reflect the changes, as it previously assumed the `sum_marks` functionality would be used to combine multiple marks.


This code implements a LangGraph workflow for automated code evaluation. Let's analyze it against the provided rubric.

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]:**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  The code correctly adds all six modules (ExtractionNode, RubricExtractionNode, InitialEvaluationNode, ReviewEvaluationNode, MarksExtractionNode, TotalMarksComputationNode) as nodes to the LangGraph.  **5 marks**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** The code correctly adds five edges representing the workflow's dependencies between the nodes. The labels are also provided.  **5 marks**

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The `build_workflow()` function creates the graph, but there's no explicit compilation step.  LangGraph likely handles the graph structure internally.  While the graph is built correctly, the absence of a clear compilation step is a minor issue.  **2 marks**  (If LangGraph has an explicit compile method that's not used, it would be 0).


**Total for Graph Construction: 12 / 14**

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Explicit Compilation (Graph Compilation):** Add a statement like `graph.compile()` if `LangGraph` has such a method.  This would clarify the compilation step and potentially improve performance or error detection in a real-world LangGraph library.

2. **Error Handling:** The `TotalMarksComputationNode` includes error handling within `sum_marks`, but other parts of the code lack robust error handling (e.g., file I/O errors, OpenAI API errors).  Adding `try-except` blocks would make the code more robust.

3. **Input Validation:** The code assumes the input files exist and are in the correct format.  Adding input validation would prevent unexpected crashes or incorrect results.

4. **Modularity:** The `main()` function is quite long.  Breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions would improve readability and maintainability.


5. **Testing:**  It would be beneficial to add unit tests to verify the functionality of each module and the overall workflow.



**Revised Code with Improvements (Illustrative):**

```python
# ... (previous code) ...

def compile_graph(graph):
    """Compiles the LangGraph (if a compile method exists)."""
    try:
        graph.compile()  # Replace with actual LangGraph compile method if it exists.
        print("Graph compiled successfully.")
    except AttributeError:
        print("Warning: LangGraph doesn't seem to have a compile method.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error compiling graph: {e}")


def run_workflow(graph, model_solution, student_submission, rubric_file):
    """Runs the LangGraph workflow."""
    try:
        # ... (Workflow execution code) ...  
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: One or more input files not found.")
        return None, None
    except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:
        print(f"OpenAI API Error: {e}")
        return None, None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None, None

    return final_feedback, total_marks



def main():
    # ... (Input file handling) ...

    graph = build_workflow()
    compile_graph(graph)

    final_feedback, total_marks = run_workflow(graph, model_solution, student_submission, rubric_file)

    # ... (Output to file) ...

# ... (rest of the code) ...
```

This revised code addresses some of the issues by adding a `compile_graph` function (which may be a placeholder depending on the LangGraph library), improved error handling, and modularization of the `main()` function.  Remember to replace `"graph.compile()"` with the actual compilation method if it's available in your `LangGraph` library.  Without the actual LangGraph library, full testing and complete implementation of a `compile()` method cannot be definitively done.


This code implements a rubric-based automated grading system using a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to manage the workflow.  However, there are several issues and areas for improvement:

**1. `gpt-4-mini` Model:**  The code uses `gpt-4-mini`. This model doesn't exist in the OpenAI API.  It's likely a placeholder or a misunderstanding.  You should use a valid model name like `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` (if you have access).  The `gpt-4` model is significantly more powerful and expensive.


**2. Java File Parsing:** The `extract_structure` method in `ExtractionNode` is a stub.  It needs actual code to parse Java files and extract class and method information.  This would likely involve using a Java parser library (e.g., `javaparser`).  Simply returning a hardcoded structure is not functional.


**3. Rubric Format:** The code assumes the rubric is in JSON format.  You need to define a clear and consistent JSON schema for your rubric.  The example only shows `rubric["correct_structure_points"]`.  A real rubric would have more complex criteria and point values.


**4. `InitialEvaluationNode` Logic:** The comparison `student_structure == model_structure` is too simplistic.  It likely won't catch subtle differences or variations in code that are still functionally correct.  This needs to be significantly improved to use the rubric's criteria for comparison.


**5. `TotalMarksComputationNode`:** The `sum_marks` function is unnecessarily complex. It converts a single integer (`adjusted_marks`) into a string, then splits and sums it. This is a convoluted way of just returning the original `adjusted_marks`.  Just remove it.


**6. Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling.  File I/O operations could fail, the OpenAI API call might throw exceptions, and the JSON parsing could encounter errors.  Robust error handling is essential.


**7. Input Files:** The code assumes input files exist in the `input/` directory.  You'll need to create this directory and provide the necessary files (`problem_description.txt`, `model_solution.java`, `rubric.json`, `student_submission.java`).


**8. OpenAI API Key:**  Hardcoding the OpenAI API key directly in the script is a security risk.  It's best to store it as an environment variable.


**Improved Code (with some corrections and placeholders):**

```python
import os
import json
import openai
from langgraph import LangGraph, Node, Edge

# Get OpenAI API key from environment variable
openai.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not openai.api_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set.")


# ... (ExtractionNode and RubricExtractionNode remain largely the same, but need implementation for Java parsing and JSON rubric)

    # ... (Handle potential JSON loading errors) ...


class InitialEvaluationNode(Node):
    def run(self, student_structure, model_structure, rubric):
        # ... (Implement a more sophisticated comparison using the rubric) ...


class ReviewEvaluationNode(Node):
    def run(self, feedback, marks):
        gpt_prompt = "Provide detailed feedback for the following evaluation:\n" + "\n".join(feedback)
        try:
            response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Use a valid model
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": gpt_prompt}]
            )
            gpt_feedback = response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()
        except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:
            print(f"OpenAI API error: {e}")
            gpt_feedback = "Error getting feedback from OpenAI."
        final_feedback = feedback + [gpt_feedback, "TA review completed."]
        return final_feedback, marks  # Removed arbitrary +2


class MarksExtractionNode(Node):
    def run(self, adjusted_marks):
        return adjusted_marks


class TotalMarksComputationNode(Node):
    def run(self, extracted_marks):
        return extracted_marks # No need for sum_marks


# ... (build_workflow and main functions remain largely the same, but add error handling) ...

def main():
    # ... (Add robust error handling for file I/O and OpenAI API calls) ...
```

Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pip install langgraph openai javaparser` (and any other libraries your Java parsing solution requires).  You will also need to create realistic input files for the system to work correctly.  The improved code provides a better foundation, but significant work is still required to implement the core logic of Java parsing, rubric-based comparison, and feedback generation.
