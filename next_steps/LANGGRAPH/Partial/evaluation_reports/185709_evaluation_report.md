## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract Java classes but lacks precision.  It doesn't explicitly specify the desired output format (e.g., JSON), making parsing difficult and error-prone.  The prompt should be more structured and provide clear instructions on the desired output format.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM response, but it relies on assumptions about the response structure. The `json.loads()` function will fail if the LLM response is not valid JSON.  Robust error handling and a more flexible parsing method are needed.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not properly saved into the `ExtractionState` object. The code attempts to save to `state.student_classes`, but this variable is not consistently initialized or handled across all functions, resulting in a runtime error.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract rubric details but lacks sufficient detail on how to match rubric sections with specific classes. The prompt needs to be more specific and explicit about what should be returned in the JSON output.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Similar to the class extraction, the parsing relies on `json.loads()`, which is not robust. The code should handle potential errors in parsing the LLM response.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted rubrics are not saved correctly into the `ExtractionState` object. The code has similar issues as in class extraction â€“ the variable is not consistently initialized and handled.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is completely missing.  No prompt design or implementation is present.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is completely missing.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is completely missing.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is completely missing.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is completely missing.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is completely missing.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The graph construction correctly adds nodes for class extraction, rubric extraction, evaluation, review, marks extraction and total marks calculation.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges connecting the nodes are correctly defined, representing a logical workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles successfully, indicating a correct structure.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a basic understanding of LangGraph's workflow structure and successfully constructed the graph. However, the core evaluation modules (initial evaluation, review evaluation, marks extraction, and total marks calculation) are entirely missing.  The prompts for class and rubric extraction lack precision, and the parsing logic is insufficiently robust.  Focus on implementing the missing modules and improving prompt design and error handling.


Based on the provided code and error message, the student's code fails due to a missing attribute `class_evaluations` in the `ExtractionState` class.  The rubric doesn't specify points for individual modules, so the marking will focus on the presence and correctness of the code sections.

**Marking Breakdown:**

* **Class Extraction Modules (extract_student_classes, extract_model_classes):**  Both functions are correctly structured to use the LLM and parse JSON responses.  They include error handling for JSON parsing failures.  **Award 10 marks (5 marks each).**

* **Rubric Extraction Module (extract_rubric_for_classes):** This function also follows the correct structure for LLM invocation and JSON parsing with error handling. **Award 5 marks.**

* **Initial Evaluation Module (generate_evaluation_prompt, evaluate_classes):** `generate_evaluation_prompt` is correctly implemented. The `evaluate_classes` function has the correct structure but fails due to the missing attribute.  While functionally incomplete due to the error, the attempt demonstrates understanding of the iterative process.  **Award 7 marks (3 for generate_evaluation_prompt and 4 for evaluate_classes).**

* **Review Evaluation Module (generate_review_prompt, review_evaluations):** Similar to the initial evaluation module, `generate_review_prompt` is correct. `review_evaluations` is structurally correct but dependent on the output of the previous step which failed.  **Award 7 marks (3 for generate_review_prompt and 4 for review_evaluations).**

* **Marks Extraction Module (extract_marks):** Correctly implemented for extracting marks. **Award 5 marks.**

* **Total Marks Calculation Module (sum_marks, calculate_total_marks):** `sum_marks` tool is correctly defined. `calculate_total_marks` uses the tool and has the correct structure for LLM use.  **Award 6 marks (3 for sum_marks and 3 for calculate_total_marks).**

* **Save Final Evaluations Module (save_final_evaluations):** Correctly implemented. **Award 5 marks.**

* **LangGraph Workflow Construction:** The graph creation is correctly implemented.  **Award 5 marks.**

**Total Marks Awarded: 45 / 50**

The missing `class_evaluations` attribute in the `ExtractionState` class caused the major failure.  If this were corrected, the program would likely run to completion, but the accuracy of the LLM output and the overall functionality is not assessed within this rubric.  The code demonstrates a strong understanding of the individual components, showing solid progress toward a complete solution.


The code has a critical flaw: the `ExtractionState` class does not initially possess the `class_evaluations` attribute.  The error message clearly states: `'ExtractionState' object has no attribute 'class_evaluations'`.

**Grading Rubric Evaluation (based on the provided code and error):**


* **Module 1: Class Extraction (extract_student_classes, extract_model_classes):**  Potentially functional (0/20). The code appears to attempt to extract classes, but its effectiveness cannot be determined without a successful execution.  The extraction and JSON parsing logic needs testing and error handling to make it fully functional.


* **Module 2: Rubric Extraction (extract_rubric_for_classes):** Potentially functional (0/20). Similar to Module 1, functionality cannot be assessed due to the failure before this module is reached.


* **Module 3: Initial Evaluation (evaluate_classes):** **Fails due to previous error (0/20).** This module fails because `state.class_evaluations` is accessed before being initialized.  The error originates from this line: `if state.class_evaluations is None:`


* **Module 4: Review Evaluation (review_evaluations):** **Fails due to previous error (0/20).**  This module relies on the successful completion of the initial evaluation module.


* **Module 5: Marks Extraction (extract_marks):** **Fails due to previous error (0/20).**  This module will fail because `state.final_class_evaluations` is populated by `review_evaluations`, which itself failed.


* **Module 6: Total Marks Calculation (calculate_total_marks):** **Fails due to previous error (0/20).**  This module is dependent on the successful completion of prior modules.



* **Overall Structure and Workflow:** Partially implemented (5/10). The LangGraph structure is mostly correct, but the fundamental error prevents any successful execution.


**Total Score: 5/120**

**Specific Feedback:**

1. **Initialize `class_evaluations`:** The primary issue is that `class_evaluations` needs to be initialized as an empty dictionary within the `ExtractionState` class's `__init__` method.  This will solve the `AttributeError`.

2. **Robust Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling to the JSON parsing sections.  Currently, it only prints an error message and continues.  More sophisticated handling (like raising exceptions or returning appropriate error states) is necessary for a production-ready system.

3. **Testing:** Thorough testing is essential.  Provide sample student code, model code, and rubric content to demonstrate the workflow's functionality.

4. **Output:** The output (`final_evaluations.txt`) is not available to examine as the code fails before reaching the saving stage.  The correctness of the file writing needs verification once the prior issues are resolved.

To fix the code, add `self.class_evaluations = {}` to the `__init__` method of the `ExtractionState` class.  Then, run the code with appropriate inputs to see whether other errors arise.  Remember to add extensive testing for a proper evaluation.


The provided code has a critical error:  `AttributeError: 'ExtractionState' object has no attribute 'class_evaluations'`. This is because `class_evaluations` is defined in the `ExtractionState` class but is not initialized in the `__init__` method.  The `if state.class_evaluations is None:` check in `evaluate_classes` is attempting to access this attribute before it exists, leading to the error.

Furthermore, the prompt design for class extraction is adequate but could be improved.  The current prompts simply ask the LLM to extract classes.  More robust prompts should include instructions on handling potential errors (e.g., multiple classes in one file, malformed Java code), specifying the desired output format precisely (e.g., JSON with class names as keys and code as values), and perhaps providing examples.

Here's a revised code addressing the error and improving prompt design:

```python

        state.model_classes = {}
    return state

# ... (rest of the code remains largely the same, except for the error correction in ExtractionState and improved prompts above) ...

```

This revised code initializes `class_evaluations` correctly and uses improved prompts that are more specific and resilient to potential LLM errors.  Remember to install the necessary libraries (`langgraph`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-openai`).  The rubric scoring and total mark calculation parts still require further refinement for robustness.  Error handling needs improvement throughout the code to deal with potential LLM failures.  Consider adding more comprehensive error checking and logging.


The code has a critical flaw:  `state.class_evaluations` is not properly initialized.  The error message clearly states `'ExtractionState' object has no attribute 'class_evaluations'`.  While the `evaluate_classes` function attempts to initialize it, the check `if state.class_evaluations is None:` will always fail because it's not initializing the attribute in the `ExtractionState` class's `__init__` method, only in the function.

Here's a corrected version with explanations of the changes and addressing the rubric criteria:

**Rubric Assessment:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompts are well-structured and include all necessary details (code, rubric, instructions).  The `generate_evaluation_prompt` function ensures all relevant information is passed to the LLM.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code attempts to handle JSON parsing correctly using `json.loads`.  However, error handling could be improved.  Instead of just printing an error and assigning an empty dictionary, consider raising a custom exception or logging the error more comprehensively for debugging.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The corrected code now saves the rubric details (`class_evaluations` and `final_class_evaluations`) correctly within the `ExtractionState` object, using the `__init__` to initialize and ensure it's always available.

**Further Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) to catch potential issues during JSON parsing and LLM interaction.
* **Input Validation:** Add input validation to check the format of the student code, model code, and rubric before processing.
* **LLM Response Handling:**  The code assumes the LLM will return JSON.  This is not guaranteed;  implement more flexible parsing to handle diverse LLM outputs.  Consider using a dedicated library for parsing structured responses from LLMs.
* **Rubric Structure:** The rubric is currently assumed to be in a specific JSON format.  Make it more flexible to accommodate different rubric structures.  The current code is brittle to rubric formatting changes.
* **Modularity:** Break down the large functions into smaller, more manageable ones for better readability and maintainability.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Ensure all I/O-bound operations (like file reading and LLM calls) are truly asynchronous to improve performance, especially with multiple classes.


The revised code addresses the core issue and provides a more robust foundation for the rubric evaluation system. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `langgraph`, `langchain`, `openai`.  You will also need to set up an OpenAI API key.


The code has a critical flaw: the `ExtractionState` class doesn't initially have the `class_evaluations` attribute, leading to an `AttributeError`.  The code attempts to initialize it in `evaluate_classes` only *if* it's `None`, but the initial state of the attribute isn't `None`; it's undefined.  This means the code crashes before it even starts properly evaluating classes.

```

**Key Improvements:**

* **`class_evaluations` Initialization:**  The `class_evaluations` attribute is now correctly initialized as an empty dictionary within the `ExtractionState` constructor. This eliminates the `AttributeError`.
* **Error Handling in `extract_marks`:** Added a `try...except` block to handle potential `json.JSONDecodeError`, `KeyError`, and `TypeError` exceptions that might arise from unexpected LLM output.  It now gracefully handles these errors instead of crashing.
* **Robust JSON Handling:** Added a `json.loads` within `extract_marks` to parse the string output from the LLM, which is more likely to be a JSON string than a dictionary.
* **`main` Function:** Created a `main` function for cleaner execution using asyncio.run.  This makes the code more modular and easier to test.
* **Added Temperature to LLM:** A temperature of 0 was added to the LLM initialization for more consistent and deterministic responses.  Experiment with different temperature values if necessary.
* **Example Usage:** Included example code to show how to run the script.  Remember to replace the placeholder code, model, and rubric with your actual content.



Remember to install the necessary libraries:  `langgraph`, `langchain`, `langchain-openai`.  You'll also need an OpenAI API key configured for `langchain_openai`.  Adjust the `model` parameter in `ChatOpenAI` if needed.  The rubric should be formatted as a JSON array of criterion objects, each containing a "criterion" and a "weight" property.  The LLM responses must be structured in a way that the `extract_marks` function can correctly parse the scores. You will need to adapt the prompt engineering to get the LLM to output evaluation results in this structured way.


The code has a key issue:  `state.class_evaluations` is not correctly initialized.  The `if state.class_evaluations is None:` check in `evaluate_classes` is ineffective because  `ExtractionState` initializes `class_evaluations` as an empty dictionary (`{}`), not `None`.  This leads to the `AttributeError`.

**Rubric Scoring:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompts are well-structured, clearly explaining the task to the LLM.  The improved `generate_review_prompt` handles potential errors in the initial evaluation JSON. The instruction to return a JSON object in the review prompt is crucial for structured output.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**  The code correctly extracts the reviewed evaluation and adjustments, using `json.loads` to parse JSON responses and including error handling for JSON decoding failures.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves the reviewed evaluation using the `save_final_evaluations` function.


This revised code addresses the original error, improves the robustness of the parsing, and enhances the prompt design for better LLM interaction.  Remember to replace placeholder comments (`//Student Code`, etc.) with your actual data and install the necessary libraries (`langgraph`, `langchain`, `openai`).  You'll also need an OpenAI API key.  The addition of `temperature=0` in the LLM initialization helps ensure consistent outputs from the model.  Remember to adjust the temperature as needed.


The error "'ExtractionState' object has no attribute 'class_evaluations'" arises because you are attempting to access `state.class_evaluations` before it's been initialized.  The `evaluate_classes` function checks if it's `None`, but only initializes it *if* it's `None`.  The problem is that the very first time `evaluate_classes` is called, the condition `state.class_evaluations is None` is true, so it creates the empty dictionary.  However,  `state.class_evaluations[class_name] = response.content` accesses it immediately after creating it. This works the first time for the first class. But the next time this function is called within the loop it already exists and thus the error. The `class_evaluations` attribute should be initialized in the `ExtractionState` constructor.

Remember to install the necessary libraries: `langgraph`, `langchain`, `openai`.  Also, make sure you have your OpenAI API key set up correctly in your environment variables.  The improved `extract_marks` function includes error handling for robustness.  The prompt is also modified to explicitly instruct the LLM to return a JSON object, making parsing easier and more reliable.  The `main` function provides a runnable example.  This corrected version directly addresses the attribute error and improves the overall reliability of the marks extraction. The `temperature` parameter in `ChatOpenAI` is set to 0 to make the LLM responses more deterministic and consistent.

The provided code has several issues preventing it from correctly calculating the total marks according to the rubric.  The primary problem lies in the `calculate_total_marks` function and its interaction with the `sum_marks` tool, as well as a missing import for `uuid`.

Here's a breakdown of the problems and a corrected version:

**Problems:**

1. **`sum_marks` Tool Usage:** The prompt design in `calculate_total_marks` doesn't effectively use the `sum_marks` tool.  It simply asks the LLM to calculate the sum, rather than using the tool directly. This violates the prompt design requirement of the rubric.

2. **Output Extraction:**  The code attempts to store the result of `sum_marks` in `state.total_marks`.  However, since the LLM, not the `sum_marks` tool, is performing the calculation, the extracted output is a string representation of the sum (e.g., "15"), not an integer.

3. **Missing `uuid` Import:** The code uses `uuid.uuid4()` but doesn't import the `uuid` module.

4. **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling. For instance, if the LLM's response isn't a valid integer, the `sum_marks` function will throw an exception.

5. **`ExtractionState` attribute:** The `ExtractionState` class has a `class_evaluations` attribute, which needs to be initialized as a dictionary in `__init__` to avoid the `AttributeError` shown in the traceback.


**Corrected Code:**

```python

# Execute the graph and save results
await class_extraction_graph.ainvoke(state, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": str(uuid.uuid4())}})
save_final_evaluations(state)
```

This revised code directly utilizes the `sum_marks` tool, improving prompt design and enabling more reliable total marks calculation.  Remember to replace the placeholder comments (`//Student code`, `//Model code`, `//Rubric`) with your actual student code, model solution, and rubric content.  Error handling is also improved, making the code more robust.  The `uuid` module is now imported.  Finally, the `total_marks` variable is correctly converted to an integer and better error handling is added for all functions. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`langgraph`, `langchain`, `openai`).

The provided code has several issues preventing it from running correctly and achieving a proper LangGraph workflow.  Let's address them systematically, focusing on the rubric criteria:

**1. `ExtractionState` Initialization and Attribute Error:**

The primary error is `AttributeError: 'ExtractionState' object has no attribute 'class_evaluations'`. This is because you create an `ExtractionState` object, but you never *populate* it with the initial content needed before invoking the LangGraph.  You need to create an instance of `ExtractionState` *with the student code, model code, and rubric content* before passing it to `class_extraction_graph.ainvoke()`.

**2. Missing Input Data:**

The code is missing the crucial steps of loading the student's code, the model's code, and the rubric. Before the LangGraph runs, you must provide these as strings to the `ExtractionState` object.

**3. JSON Parsing and Error Handling:**

While the code attempts to handle `JSONDecodeError`, it's crucial to ensure the LLM responses are actually valid JSON.  The prompts need careful crafting to guarantee well-structured JSON output.  Consider using a more robust error handling mechanism that helps debug invalid JSON outputs from the LLM.  For example, log the LLM's response before attempting to parse it.

**4.  Rubric Criteria Data Structure:**

The rubric criteria in `state.class_rubric_mapping` are assumed to be a list, but the code does not specify the exact format of this list within the evaluation and review prompts. If each rubric criterion has a score and description, it should be represented as a dictionary within the list or a list of dictionaries. This needs to be consistent across the `generate_evaluation_prompt` and `generate_review_prompt` functions.

**5. `extract_marks` Function:**

The `extract_marks` function assumes a specific structure within `state.final_class_evaluations` that might not always be consistent. It needs better error handling (e.g., using `get` with a default value) to avoid exceptions if the expected keys are missing.

**6. Graph Construction (Rubric Evaluation):**

The graph construction is mostly correct regarding node and edge addition, but the absence of input data and the error in `ExtractionState` prevent it from working.


**Revised Code with Corrections:**

This revised code addresses the key issues:

Remember to replace the placeholder code with your actual file contents.  This revised code includes more robust error handling, clearer data structures, and addresses the core issues causing the `AttributeError`.  Thoroughly test this revised code with various inputs to ensure its robustness.  Consider adding more comprehensive logging to track the execution flow and identify any unexpected behavior.


The error message `'ExtractionState' object has no attribute 'class_evaluations'` is clear: you're trying to access `state.class_evaluations` before it has been created.  The problem lies in how you're initializing and using `class_evaluations` within the `evaluate_classes` function and the overall workflow.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

    save_final_evaluations(state)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

**Key Changes:**

1. **`ExtractionState` Initialization:** The `class_evaluations` dictionary is now correctly initialized as an empty dictionary within the `__init__` method of the `ExtractionState` class.  This ensures that it exists *before* `evaluate_classes` tries to use it.

2. **Error Handling (Optional but Recommended):**  Consider adding more robust error handling within your functions (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to catch potential issues with LLM responses, JSON parsing, or other unexpected exceptions.

3. **Initial State Data:** The `main` async function now provides the `ExtractionState` with placeholder sample data for `student_code`, `model_code`, and `rubric`. **You MUST replace these placeholders with your actual student code, model code, and rubric data.**  The rubric should ideally be in JSON format.


4. **`asyncio.run(main())`:**  The code is now properly structured to use `asyncio`.  The `main` function is defined as `async` and then executed using `asyncio.run(main())`.


Remember to install the necessary libraries: `langgraph`, `langchain`, `openai`. You'll also need to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.  The example above uses  `gpt-3.5-turbo`, but you might need to adjust it based on your access and pricing preferences.  Also, make sure the JSON format of your rubric is correct; invalid JSON will cause a failure to parse.
