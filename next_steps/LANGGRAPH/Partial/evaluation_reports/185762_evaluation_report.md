## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [4/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design is partially correct. It attempts to extract classes using a regular expression, but the prompt itself does not involve an LLM and doesn't leverage the capabilities of LangChain or LangGraph for prompt engineering.  The prompt is also not flexible enough for different Java code structures and naming conventions.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The code correctly uses regular expressions to extract class names and their code blocks.  The parsing is functional for the provided sample input but might be prone to errors with more complex code.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not properly saved into the LangGraph state for use by subsequent modules.  The state mechanism is not utilized, therefore, information isn't passed between nodes of the LangGraph.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [4/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design is partially complete.  Similar to the class extraction, this part also lacks LLM integration. The use of regular expressions shows an attempt to extract rubric details but lacks robustness.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The regular expression attempts to extract rubric sections for each class,  but its reliability is questionable depending on the rubric formatting. The code works for the sample input, but might fail for other rubrics.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are not saved into the LangGraph state. State management is missing, thus preventing data flow within the LangGraph workflow.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing. No attempt is made to use an LLM to perform initial evaluation based on the extracted classes and rubric details.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing, so no parsing or extraction is performed.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing, so no state saving is done.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing. The `sum_marks` tool is not utilized.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student has attempted to create nodes representing the different modules. Although the functionality of many nodes is not complete, the nodes themselves are correctly defined.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges between the nodes reflect the intended workflow. The connections between the nodes are appropriately defined, though the flow between nodes is currently non-functional as no state is passed between nodes.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The provided code demonstrates an attempt to compile the LangGraph. While the functionality within the nodes remains incomplete, the compilation of the graph itself is correctly implemented.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates some understanding of using regular expressions for text processing and of the LangGraph framework for structuring the workflow.  However, the core functionality of the assignment, which is evaluating code using LLMs, is missing. The student needs to integrate LLMs effectively within LangChain and utilize the state variable mechanism for data flow between LangGraph nodes.  Focus on completing the LLM-based evaluation modules and implementing proper state management.


Here's a rubric-based evaluation of the provided Jupyter Notebook.  I'll score each section based on the provided rubric and the code's functionality against the stated goals.  Note that error handling and compilation are excluded per the instructions.


**1. LLM API Key Input (Initial Step) (5 points)**

* **Score:** 5/5
* **Rationale:** The code correctly requests and stores the LLM API key in the `state` dictionary.  This key is then available for use in subsequent modules (though not actually used in this solution). The input mechanism fulfills the requirement.

**2. Class Extraction Module (15 points)**

* **Score:** 10/15
* **Rationale:** The code uses regular expressions (`re.findall`) to extract class names.  This partially fulfills the goal. However, the crucial step of validating the extraction using the LLM is missing.  The rubric specifically mentions using the LLM for validation.  Without that LLM call and validation step, a significant portion of the marks are lost.

**3. Rubric Extraction Module (15 points)**

* **Score:** 10/15
* **Rationale:**  The code extracts rubric details. The rubric extraction utilizes regular expressions to identify sections of the rubric corresponding to specific classes. This is partially correct.  However, the solution relies on hardcoded patterns that are likely to break if the rubric's structure changes. A more robust solution would use more flexible methods or LLM-based analysis to extract rubric sections. The solution successfully extracts the required information from the provided `rubric.md` file given its particular format, though the robustness is not ideal.


**4. Evaluation Module (10 points)**

* **Score:** 5/10
* **Rationale:** The evaluation is entirely simulated. The code doesn't actually compare the student solution to the model solution or apply any rubric-based scoring; it just simulates a match and assigns a score.  The goal was to evaluate against both the rubric and model solution; this is absent.  Therefore, only partial credit is given for the attempt at structured evaluation output.

**5. Review Evaluation Module (5 points)**

* **Score:** 5/5
* **Rationale:**  The code simulates a review process and adjusts the scores. While the score adjustment is simulated, the code correctly processes the existing (simulated) evaluation results and produces a "reviewed" output. The structure and functionality match the rubric's requirements.

**6. Total Marks Calculation Module (0 points)**

* **Score:** 0/0
* **Rationale:** The rubric states to "Sum the marks for all rubric criteria using the `sum_marks` tool". There's no such tool used; total marks are arbitrarily added.

**7. Final Output Module (0 points)**

* **Score:** 0/0
* **Rationale:** The final output module works as intended, generating a report based on the existing state.  However, because the previous modules significantly failed to achieve their intended goals and produce valid input for the final output, this module has minimal functional value in the context of the complete assessment system.


**Total Score: 35/50**

The notebook demonstrates some understanding of the task, correctly implementing some aspects of the workflow (input, simulated review, and final output). However, the core evaluation steps are significantly flawed, lacking the necessary LLM integration and robust rubric parsing to achieve the evaluation goals.  The reliance on hardcoded patterns and simulated evaluation drastically reduces the functionality and score.


## Module 2 Rubric Evaluation

This evaluation assesses Module 2 based on the provided code and rubric instructions.  The assessment is strictly based on what's demonstrably implemented in the code, without making assumptions or filling in gaps.

**1. LLM API Key Input (Initial Step):**

* **Score: 1/1**
The code correctly requests the LLM API key once at the start and stores it in the `state` dictionary.  This key is then available for use in subsequent modules (though no module actually *uses* the key in the provided code).


**2. Class Extraction Module:**

* **Score: 1/1**
The `ClassExtractionNode` successfully uses a regular expression to extract class names from the provided Java code. The extracted classes are stored in the `state` dictionary.  The regex could be improved for robustness, but the core functionality is present and working based on the example input.


**3. Rubric Extraction Module:**

* **Score: 1/1**
The `RubricExtractionNode` extracts rubric details. The regular expression is designed to target specific sections of the rubric based on its example structure.  The extraction works correctly given the sample rubric's formatting.  However, this implementation is brittle; a slight change to the rubric format would likely break it.


**4. Evaluation Module:**

* **Score: 1/1**
The `EvaluationNode` simulates the evaluation process.  It successfully iterates through extracted classes and their associated rubric details. The output reflects a simulated match with the model solution.  The evaluation logic itself is a placeholder, but the integration with previous modules is functional.


**5. Review Evaluation Module:**

* **Score: 1/1**
The `ReviewNode` simulates a review process, iterating over the initial evaluations. It applies a simulated score adjustment, demonstrating the basic structure of a review step.  Again, the review logic is a stand-in.


**6. Total Marks Calculation Module:**

* **Score: 1/1**
The `TotalMarksCalculationNode` successfully calculates a total score based on the simulated scores from the review module. The calculation correctly sums up the simulated marks.


**7. Final Output Module:**

* **Score: 1/1**
The `generate_final_output` function correctly compiles a report from the state variables and saves it to a file.  The file writing functionality works as intended.


**Overall Score: 7/7**

**Feedback:**

While the code fulfills the basic requirements of each module, it relies heavily on simulated data and brittle regular expressions.  For a robust system:

* **Improve Regular Expressions:**  The regular expressions used for class extraction and rubric extraction are susceptible to failure if the input data's format changes slightly. More robust and flexible regular expressions or alternative parsing techniques (e.g., using a dedicated Java parser) are needed.

* **Implement Actual Evaluation:** The evaluation and review modules currently simulate evaluation and scoring.  Replace these with actual code that performs meaningful comparison between student code, model solution, and rubric criteria.  Consider using tools for code similarity analysis or static analysis.

* **Error Handling:** Add error handling to gracefully manage situations such as missing files, incorrect file formats, or unexpected input.

* **LLM Integration:** The LLM API key is collected but not used. Integrate the LLM to improve the accuracy and robustness of class extraction, rubric interpretation, and code evaluation.  This would make the system significantly more advanced.

* **Modularity and Testability:** Improve code modularity by breaking down larger functions into smaller, more testable units.  Writing unit tests would significantly improve the quality and maintainability of the code.


The code demonstrates a functional framework, but significant improvements are needed to achieve a production-ready automatic assessment system.


This Jupyter Notebook outlines a system for automatically evaluating student Java code. Let's analyze its adherence to the provided rubric for Module 3 ("Extract Class Method").

**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The code doesn't explicitly use an LLM.  It relies on regular expressions (`re.findall`) to extract class names from the Java code.  Therefore, there's no LLM prompt to evaluate.  This section receives **0 marks** because the core requirement of using an LLM is absent.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The regular expression `class\\s+(\\w+)\\s*\\{[\\s\\S]*?\\}` attempts to find Java class declarations.  While functional for simple cases, it's prone to errors with complex class declarations (e.g., nested classes, generics, annotations).  The extraction is partial and might miss classes in more intricate code.  This receives **1 mark** due to partial functionality and potential inaccuracies.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly uses the `state` dictionary to store the extracted classes (`self.state['extracted_classes'] = matches`).  This earns **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Module 3:** 0 + 1 + 1 = **2 marks out of 6**

**Improvements:**

1. **Integrate an LLM:** The most crucial improvement is to replace the regex-based class extraction with an LLM.  The prompt should clearly instruct the LLM to extract individual Java classes, providing the code as input.  Example prompt:

   ```
   Extract all Java classes from the following code.  Return each class as a separate code block, clearly labeled with the class name.

   ```java
   [Student Java Code Here]
   ```
   ```

2. **Robustness:**  The current regex is brittle.  An LLM is far more robust at handling variations in Java code syntax.

3. **Error Handling:** Add error handling for cases where the LLM fails to parse the code or returns unexpected output.

4. **Model Solution Extraction:** The rubric requires extracting classes from both student and model solutions. The current code only processes student code.  The same LLM approach should be applied to the model solution.

5. **Comparison:**  The evaluation currently simulates a match with the model solution.  A more robust approach would involve a deeper comparison of the extracted classes (e.g., comparing their methods and attributes, potentially using an LLM for semantic similarity checks).

By addressing these points, the code can achieve a significantly higher score on the rubric.  The reliance on simple regex is a major weakness in this approach to code evaluation.  LLMs provide a much more flexible and reliable solution.


Let's evaluate the provided code against the rubric for Module 4: **Extract Rubric Method**.

**1. Prompt Design (3 marks):**

The code doesn't directly use an LLM; instead, it uses regular expressions to extract rubric information.  Therefore, there's no LLM prompt to evaluate.  This approach completely bypasses the intention of the rubric item, which explicitly mentions using an LLM.  This would receive a score of **0 marks**.

**2. Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**

The code successfully extracts rubric details using regular expressions (`re.search`, `re.findall`).  The extraction is reasonably complete given the highly structured format of the sample `rubric.md`. However, it's highly dependent on this specific format; any deviation would likely cause failure.  It would receive a score of **1 mark** due to this lack of robustness.  A true LLM approach would handle more variability in input.

**3. State Saving (1 mark):**

The code correctly saves the extracted rubric details in the `state` dictionary (`self.state['rubric_details'] = rubric_details`).  This would receive **1 mark**.


**Overall Score for Module 4: Extract Rubric Method:**

0 + 1 + 1 = **2 marks out of 6**

**Reasons for Low Score and Improvements:**

The core issue is that the code doesn't fulfill the prompt's requirement of using an LLM. The use of regular expressions is a much simpler approach and is brittle (i.e., only works for very specific rubric formats). To achieve a higher score, the solution should:

1. **Integrate an LLM:**  Use a library like `openai` or similar to interact with an LLM API.
2. **Craft an LLM Prompt:** Design a prompt that instructs the LLM to extract the rubric information for each class from the `rubric.md` file. The prompt should be designed to be robust and handle different formatting styles.  An example prompt might be:

   ```
   Extract the rubric information for each Java class from the following text.  The output should be a JSON object where keys are class names and values are the corresponding rubric descriptions.

   ``` followed by the content of `rubric.md`

3. **Handle LLM Output:**  Parse the JSON response from the LLM to extract the class names and their respective rubric details.  Include error handling in case the LLM response is not in the expected format.

4. **Maintain Robustness:** The system should gracefully handle cases where the LLM fails to extract information for a class or if the rubric is malformed.

By incorporating an LLM and addressing the robustness issues, the code could achieve a much higher score on this module.  The current implementation is functionally correct for a *very* specific input format, but it fundamentally misses the point of the assessment.


Here's an evaluation of the provided Jupyter Notebook code based on the rubric you provided.  I'll break it down by section of the rubric.

**3. Initial Evaluation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The notebook doesn't explicitly show a user-facing prompt for the evaluation. The code implies the existence of `student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, and `model_solution.md` files, which are necessary inputs. However, these aren't included, and the prompt is essentially implicit within the code's structure.  Therefore,  **2 marks**.  A properly structured prompt (including the files and instructions on how to provide them) would earn 3 marks.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code successfully extracts class names, rubric details (although the regex might be brittle), and generates evaluation results. The output is printed to the console, but it's structured and easily parsable.  **2 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code uses a dictionary `state` effectively to store and pass data (API key, extracted classes, rubric details, evaluation results) between different nodes (classes). This demonstrates good state management.  **1 mark**.

**Total Score for Module 5: 5 / 6**


**Areas for Improvement:**

* **Robustness of Regex:** The regular expressions used for class extraction and rubric extraction are somewhat simplistic and might fail if the input files deviate slightly from the assumed format. More robust regex or alternative parsing techniques (e.g., using a dedicated parser for markdown or Java code) should be considered.

* **Error Handling:**  The code lacks error handling.  What happens if `student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, or `model_solution.md` are missing or unreadable?  What happens if the regex fails to find a class or rubric section?  Adding `try-except` blocks would significantly improve the robustness.

* **Explicit Prompt:** The most crucial improvement is to create a clear and well-defined prompt that explains the input requirements (the three files) and the expected output.  This prompt should be presented before the code execution.

* **LLM Integration (Missing):** The instructions mention using an LLM for class validation. This aspect is completely absent from the provided code.  The LLM call should be included, along with appropriate error handling for API calls.

* **Simulated Evaluation:**  The evaluation is simulated. The code doesn't actually compare the student code to the model solution, nor does it use a rubric to score specific aspects.  This needs to be replaced with actual comparative analysis and scoring based on rubric criteria.  The rubric itself is only partially shown and not programmatically parsed.

* **Clarity and Comments:** While the code is reasonably well-structured, more detailed comments explaining the logic in each function would improve readability and maintainability.


**In summary:** The code demonstrates the basic structure of a modular evaluation system, but significant work is required to make it robust, complete (including LLM integration), and functionally accurate.  The simulated evaluation is a placeholder and needs substantial enhancement.


Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook code and the rubric, here's an evaluation of Module 6 ("Review Evaluation Module"):

**4. Review Evaluation Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The code doesn't explicitly use prompts for an LLM. The review process is entirely simulated within the `ReviewNode` class.  There's no interaction with an LLM to review the initial evaluation. Therefore, a score of **0 marks** is given for this criterion.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**  Since there's no LLM interaction, there's no LLM output to parse. The `ReviewNode` directly manipulates the existing `evaluation_results` within the program's state.  Thus, the extraction is done internally within the code, not from an external LLM response.  A score of **0 marks** is given because this doesn't fulfill the rubric's intent.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves the reviewed evaluation in the `state` dictionary under the key `'reviewed_results'`.  Therefore, a score of **1 mark** is awarded.


**Overall Score for Module 6: 1 / 6**

**Reasoning:** The module doesn't implement the core functionality described in the rubric. The rubric clearly states that the module should use an LLM to *review and correct* the initial evaluations. The current implementation simulates this review process, making it a non-functional implementation of the requirements.  To receive a higher score, the code needs to be significantly revised to include:

1. **LLM Interaction:** Integrate an LLM API call within the `ReviewNode` class.  The prompt should clearly instruct the LLM to review the `evaluation_results` and suggest corrections or adjustments based on pre-defined criteria or the rubric's guidelines.

2. **LLM Response Handling:** Implement logic to receive the LLM's response, parse it (extracting the review and corrections), and incorporate these changes into the `reviewed_results` in the `state` dictionary.

3. **Error Handling:** Include robust error handling for cases where the LLM API call fails or the LLM's response is malformed or uninterpretable.

Only after these modifications are made will the code adequately address the rubric's requirements for Module 6.


Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook code, let's evaluate Module 7 using the rubric.

**5. Marks Extraction Method [6 marks]**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The code doesn't explicitly use prompts to extract marks from an LLM.  The marks are simulated, not extracted through LLM interaction.  Therefore, a prompt is entirely absent.  This scores **0 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**  No parsing of LLM responses is done, as there's no LLM interaction. The marks (85% for each class) are hardcoded. Therefore, this scores **0 marks**.

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The code correctly saves the simulated marks in the `state` dictionary. This part works as intended. This scores **1 mark**.

**Total for Marks Extraction Method: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 mark**


**Overall Assessment:**

The current Module 7 code does *not* fulfill the requirements of the rubric for marks extraction.  The functionality is entirely simulated; no interaction with an LLM is involved in determining the marks. To achieve a higher score, the code would need to:

1. **Integrate an LLM:**  Use an API call to an LLM (like OpenAI's API) to analyze the student code and rubric.

2. **Design Prompts:** Carefully craft prompts instructing the LLM to extract relevant numerical marks from the evaluation based on the provided code and rubric. The prompt should explicitly request marks in a comma-separated format.

3. **Implement Parsing:** Write code to correctly parse the LLM's JSON or text response to extract the comma-separated mark values. Error handling should be included to manage situations where the LLM response is unexpected or malformed.

4. **Maintain State:** Continue using the `state` dictionary to store the extracted marks efficiently for later calculation.


The current implementation might be useful as a placeholder or a simplified example, but it's not a functional implementation of marks extraction as described by the rubric.  The simulated marks and lack of LLM interaction lead to a low score.


Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook code, here's an evaluation according to the rubric:

**6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):**  The prompt isn't explicitly stated as a separate prompt to a tool named `sum_marks`. Instead, the total marks are calculated within the `TotalMarksCalculationNode` class.  The code simulates the calculation, directly summing simulated scores (85 for each class).  There's no external tool or API call involved. This is a significant departure from the rubric's requirement.  Therefore, the score is **0 marks**.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The code correctly extracts the `total_marks` from the `reviewed_results` dictionary within the `calculate_total_marks` function.  However, because there's no actual `sum_marks` tool, the extraction is essentially a simple summation within the code itself.  **1 mark** (partially correct because extraction happens, but not using a specified tool)


* **State Saving (1 mark):** The final total is correctly saved in the `state['total_marks']` dictionary.  **1 mark**


**Total for Section 6: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 marks**

**Overall Comments:**

The code implements a complete workflow for evaluating student code, but it significantly deviates from the rubric's requirement for using a `sum_marks` tool. The rubric's intention seems to be to test the student's ability to interface with an external tool for a specific task. The provided code performs the summation directly within the Python code. To receive a higher score, the code should be modified to include a function or a class that interacts with an external `sum_marks` tool (which would need to be defined and implemented).  The current solution simply simulates the process.


Based on the provided Jupyter Notebook code, let's evaluate the graph construction according to the rubric.  The code implements a series of modules sequentially, which can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

**1. Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**

The code defines seven modules (nodes):

1. LLM API Key Input
2. Class Extraction Module
3. Rubric Extraction Module
4. Evaluation Module
5. Review Evaluation Module
6. Total Marks Calculation Module
7. Final Output Module

All seven are present and clearly defined as classes or functions.  Therefore, **5 marks**.


**2. Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):**

The flow of data implicitly defines the edges.  Let's trace it:

1. LLM API Key Input -> Class Extraction Module (API key is passed to Class Extraction)
2. Class Extraction Module -> Rubric Extraction Module (extracted classes are used in Rubric Extraction)
3. Class Extraction Module -> Evaluation Module (extracted classes are evaluated)
4. Rubric Extraction Module -> Evaluation Module (rubric details are used in Evaluation)
5. Evaluation Module -> Review Evaluation Module (evaluation results are reviewed)
6. Review Evaluation Module -> Total Marks Calculation Module (reviewed results used for total marks)
7. Total Marks Calculation Module -> Final Output Module (total marks are part of the final report)


The code demonstrates the correct sequential flow reflecting these dependencies. Therefore, **5 marks**.


**3. Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):**

The notebook doesn't explicitly construct a graph data structure (like an adjacency list or matrix). The graph is implicitly defined by the execution order of the code cells. The code executes the modules sequentially, mirroring the edges of the DAG. This implicit representation is acceptable but not ideal for a general graph-based system.  There's no explicit compilation step like you'd find with a dedicated graph library.


However, the sequential execution correctly represents the dependencies between the modules. Therefore, **2 marks** (it works, but lacks explicit graph compilation).  A full 4 marks would require either using a graph library or explicitly creating a graph representation (nodes and edges) before execution.

**Total Score for Graph Construction:** 5 + 5 + 2 = 12 / 14


**Improvements for a better score:**

To achieve a full 14/14, the code should explicitly create a graph representation using a Python graph library (like `NetworkX`).  This would involve:

1. **Creating nodes:**  Represent each module as a node in the graph.
2. **Creating edges:** Define edges connecting nodes based on data dependencies.
3. **Graph compilation (or processing):**  Use a graph traversal algorithm (like topological sort) to ensure the modules are executed in the correct order based on the graph structure.  This would provide more robust error handling if a dependency were missing.

By incorporating these changes, the code would be significantly more modular, extensible, and easier to understand as a graph-based system.


This Jupyter Notebook outlines a system for automatically evaluating student Java code based on a rubric and a model solution.  However, it has several issues and could be significantly improved. Let's break down the code, point out problems, and suggest improvements.


**Problems and Improvements:**

1. **LLM Integration is Missing:** The notebook mentions using an LLM for class validation and rubric extraction but doesn't actually use any LLM API.  The `state['llm_api_key']` is obtained but never used.  This needs to be replaced with calls to an LLM API (like OpenAI, Cohere, etc.) using the obtained API key.  The current regex-based approaches are brittle and will fail if the code or rubric format changes slightly.

2. **Hardcoded File Paths:** The paths to `student_solution.md`, `rubric.md`, and `model_solution.md` are hardcoded.  This makes the notebook inflexible.  It should accept these paths as input parameters or use a configuration file.

3. **Regex is Brittle:** The regular expressions used for class extraction and rubric extraction are highly dependent on the precise formatting of the input files.  Slight variations in formatting will break the code.  A more robust approach would use a parser (like an ANTLR parser for Java) for class extraction and a more sophisticated NLP technique (possibly involving LLM) for rubric extraction.

4. **Simulated Evaluation:** The `EvaluationNode` and `ReviewNode` classes contain simulated evaluation logic.  The actual evaluation should involve comparing the student's code to the model solution (potentially using diff tools or static analysis) and assessing it against the extracted rubric criteria.  This could involve semantic similarity checks using LLMs to compare the functionality of the student's code to the model solution.

5. **Error Handling:** There's a lack of error handling.  The code should include `try...except` blocks to handle potential exceptions (e.g., file not found, invalid API key, regex errors, network errors when calling the LLM API).

6. **Code Clarity and Structure:** The code could be better structured.  Functions should be broken down into smaller, more focused units.  More descriptive variable names and comments would enhance readability.

7. **Score Calculation:** The scoring is entirely simulated.  A proper rubric would assign points to specific criteria.  The evaluation should accurately reflect the rubric's point allocation.


**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

This outlines a better structure, incorporating fixes for the problems above.  This is a conceptual overview – you'll need to fill in the actual LLM API calls and detailed evaluation logic.

```python
import os
import re  #Still using for simplicity; consider a proper parser
#Import your chosen LLM library (e.g., openai)

class LLMHelper: #Helper for LLM calls
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        #Initialize LLM client here

    def validate_class(self, class_code):
        #Send class_code to LLM for validation
        #Return True/False based on LLM response

    def extract_rubric_criteria(self, rubric_text, class_name):
        #Use LLM to extract criteria for class_name from rubric_text
        #Return a list of criteria

class JavaParser:
    def extract_classes(self, java_code):
        #Use a proper Java parser (ANTLR, etc.) to extract classes
        #Return a list of class names and their code

class Evaluator:
    def __init__(self, llm_helper):
        self.llm_helper = llm_helper

    def evaluate_class(self, student_code, model_code, criteria):
        #Compare student_code and model_code (using diff, static analysis, etc.)
        #Assess against criteria using semantic similarity (LLM) if needed
        #Return a score and feedback

class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_report(self, evaluation_results):
        #Create a nicely formatted report
        return report_string

def main(student_solution_path, rubric_path, model_solution_path, api_key):
    try:
        llm_helper = LLMHelper(api_key)
        parser = JavaParser()
        evaluator = Evaluator(llm_helper)
        report_generator = ReportGenerator()

        with open(student_solution_path, 'r') as f:
            student_code = f.read()
        with open(rubric_path, 'r') as f:
            rubric_text = f.read()
        with open(model_solution_path, 'r') as f:
            model_code = f.read()

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with the actual code for LLM interaction, Java parsing, code comparison, and rubric interpretation.  Consider using a more structured rubric format (like JSON) for easier parsing.  This revised structure addresses the issues of the original notebook, promoting better modularity, robustness, and accuracy.
