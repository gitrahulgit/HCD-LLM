## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 26/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks precision.  It doesn't explicitly define the desired output format, leading to inconsistent results and requiring further parsing.  The prompt could benefit from specifying the exact format (e.g., JSON).

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The student's code attempts to parse the LLM output, however, it is not robust and prone to failure if the LLM's response format differs.  Error handling is missing. The implementation assumes a specific structure from the LLM which may not be consistent.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not saved properly into the state. The function returns without updating the state dictionary.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [6/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt effectively guides the LLM to extract rubric details. It's clear and well-structured, prompting for structured output in JSON or a similar format.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The code correctly parses the LLM's response, extracting the relevant rubric sections.  The use of `pydantic` for schema validation adds robustness.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are saved correctly into the state dictionary using the provided `RubricMapping` structure.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [6/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt effectively guides the LLM towards a structured evaluation.  The clear instructions and requested JSON output format are helpful.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The response parsing is effectively structured and uses `pydantic` for type safety and error handling.

**3.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The initial evaluations are properly saved into the `AgentState`.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [6/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt for review is well-structured and clear, specifying the desired output format.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The code successfully parses the LLM's review, extracting the final assessment details.  The use of `pydantic` enhances robustness.

**4.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are saved correctly into the `AgentState`.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This method is not implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This method is not implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This method is not implemented.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This method is not implemented.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This method is not implemented.

**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The graph correctly includes nodes for each of the implemented modules.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges correctly represent the workflow's logical sequence.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph is compiled successfully, enabling execution using `final_graph.stream`.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangChain and LLM integration for structured output. The `pydantic` usage is commendable. However, the incomplete implementation of the marks extraction and total marks calculation modules significantly impacts the overall functionality. Focusing on these missing parts and enhancing error handling in parsing will improve the code.


The provided code has several issues preventing successful execution and accurate grading.  The primary problems stem from how the LLM is used and the structure of the prompts. Let's break down the issues and then suggest improvements:


**Problems:**

1. **`class_extraction_node` Function:** This function attempts to extract classes from both student and model code separately.  The prompts are flawed because they don't instruct the LLM to compare the classes; the separate invocations are pointless. The LLM will likely just return all classes it finds independently.  The comparison `if sorted(student_classes) != sorted(model_classes)` is commented out, making the class name check ineffective.

2. **`rubric_extraction_module` Function:**  This function's prompt is better, but it relies heavily on the LLM's ability to understand the rubric and code structure perfectly.  The rubric is not very structured, making it difficult for the LLM to extract meaningful mappings reliably.  Even with a well-structured rubric, the reliability of this approach is questionable.

3. **`initial_evaluation_module` Function:**  This module has similar issues.  The prompt relies on the LLM's ability to understand the rubric and the nuances of the code.  It tries to infer the score for each rubric section based on the student's code, which is a challenging task for the LLM and results in inconsistent grading. The maximum scores are hardcoded, making the module inflexible to changes in rubric point values. Error handling is minimal, and an evaluation failure leads to a generic error message.

4. **`review_evaluation_module` Function:** This module tries to review the previous evaluation.  However, given the unreliability of the initial evaluation, the review module will not significantly improve the quality of grading.

5. **Missing Modules:** `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are placeholders and do not perform any actual grading or mark aggregation.

6. **No Error Handling:**  The code lacks robust error handling.  LLM calls can fail, and the code doesn't handle these failures gracefully.



**Suggested Improvements:**

1. **Revised `class_extraction_node`:**  Combine the extraction into a single LLM call. The prompt should directly ask the LLM to identify and compare classes from student and model solutions.  The output should explicitly indicate matches and mismatches.

2. **Improved Rubric Structure:**  The rubric needs a more structured format. For instance, use a numbered list or a table.  Each rubric item should have a clear description and point value.

3. **Refined Rubric Mapping:**  Instead of relying on the LLM to create the entire rubric mapping, consider using a more rule-based or semi-automated approach.  This could involve pattern matching on the student's code based on predefined criteria from the rubric.

4. **Modular Evaluation:** Instead of one massive prompt, break down the evaluation into smaller, more manageable tasks for the LLM.  For example, evaluate each function or method separately.  This increases reliability and makes debugging easier.

5. **Robust Error Handling:**  Add `try-except` blocks around all LLM calls to handle potential errors.  Log errors properly to aid debugging.

6. **Implement Missing Modules:**  Implement `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module`.  These modules will aggregate the scores from individual evaluations.


**Example of improved `class_extraction_node` prompt:**

```python
class_extraction_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
    Extract the class names and their corresponding code blocks from the student and model solutions. 
    Compare the student's classes to those in the model solution. Indicate whether each class from the student matches a class in the model.

    Student Code:
    {student_code}

    Model Solution:
    {model_solution}

    Output format:  A JSON object with a 'classes' array. Each array element should be an object with:
    - 'student_class': Class name from the student code.
    - 'model_class': Matching class name from the model (or null if no match).
    - 'match': Boolean (true if match found, false otherwise).
    - 'student_code': Code of the student class.
    - 'model_code': Code of the matching model class (or null if no match).
    """,
    input_variables=["student_code", "model_solution"]
)
```


This revised approach requires a more significant restructuring of the entire grading system.  Instead of solely relying on the LLM for code analysis and grading, you should combine it with structured data representations, more targeted prompts, rule-based logic, and a more robust error-handling strategy.  The current approach, even with GPT-4, is too error-prone for reliable automated grading.  A more hybrid approach is far more feasible.


The code has several issues preventing it from running correctly and achieving the intended automated grading functionality.  Let's address them systematically:


**1.  `class_extraction_node` Function:**

* **Incorrect Model Solution Usage:** The `class_extraction_node` function uses the model solution incorrectly. It sends an empty string to the `student_code` field for the model solution analysis, resulting in incorrect class extraction. Both student and model code should be sent to the LLM to accurately extract classes.

* **Unnecessary Duplicate Processing:** The code runs the LLM twice, once for the student and once for the model solution. This is inefficient.  A single LLM call with both codes in the prompt would suffice.


**2. `rubric_extraction_module` Function:**

* **Assumption about `model_solution`:** This function assumes `model_solution` contains the model answer key, which is not necessarily true based on the provided code. It needs to be explicitly defined or passed in.


**3. `initial_evaluation_module` Function:**

* **Error Handling:** While there's a `try...except` block, the error handling is minimal. It should provide more informative error messages and potentially attempt retry mechanisms or alternative strategies if the LLM call fails.

* **Hardcoded Rubric Scores:**  The `rubric_scores` dictionary hardcodes the points for each rubric section. This needs to be made dynamic (extracted from the rubric itself) to allow for flexible rubric use.

* **Rubric Section Parsing:**  The code assumes a specific rubric structure. If the structure changes (e.g., different section headings), it'll fail. It needs a more robust way to parse the rubric and extract section names and point values.


**4. `review_evaluation_module` Function:**

* **Missing Initial Score Aggregation:** It assumes there's a total score to convey; however, the initial evaluation module does not provide that for use in this section.


**5. Missing Modules:**

* **`marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are empty.** These are crucial for the final grade calculation and need implementation.


**6.  Overall Structure:**

* **Data Flow:** The data flow between modules is not optimally managed. Intermediate results should be passed efficiently between functions. For instance, the total score from `initial_evaluation_module` should be directly passed to `review_evaluation_module` instead of being implicitly handled based on the structure of the rubric.

* **Dynamic Rubric Handling:** The entire system should be designed to handle different rubrics without requiring code changes.  The rubric should be parsed programmatically to determine sections, weights, and criteria.


**7.  LLM Choice:**

* Using `gpt-4o-mini` might be less effective for complex tasks like code evaluation compared to a more powerful model like `gpt-4`.


**Revised Code Structure (Conceptual):**

The code needs a substantial rewrite to address these issues. Here's a conceptual outline of a more robust structure:

1. **Rubric Parser:** A separate module to parse the rubric text, extracting section names, point values, and any other relevant information in a structured format (e.g., JSON).

2. **Code Analyzer:** A module to analyze student and model code, extracting relevant features (class names, function definitions, etc.).  Consider using a static analysis library to supplement or replace LLM analysis.

3. **Evaluation Engine:** A central module to drive the evaluation process:
    * It would use the Rubric Parser's output to create evaluation prompts.
    * It would use the Code Analyzer's output to prepare the input for the LLM.
    * It would handle LLM calls, error handling, and score aggregation.
    * It would generate a final grade based on all evaluations and rubric weights.

4. **LLM Interaction:**  Use a single, powerful LLM (gpt-4 if cost is not prohibitive) for all evaluation tasks, sending carefully structured and comprehensive prompts.


**Example (Partial - Rubric Parser):**

This is a basic example of a Rubric Parser. You'll need to adapt this depending on how your rubric is formatted.

```python
import re

def parse_rubric(rubric_text):
    rubric_data = {}
    section_pattern = r"(\d+\.\s*[^\(]+\)(?:\s*\(([0-9]+)\s*marks\))?" # Regular expression to extract section and marks
    for match in re.finditer(section_pattern, rubric_text, re.MULTILINE):
        section_name = match.group(1).strip()
        marks = int(match.group(2)) if match.group(2) else 0
        rubric_data[section_name] = marks
    return rubric_data

# Example usage
rubric = """
1. Compilation and Execution (10 marks)
2. User Input Handling (10 marks)
3. String Manipulations:
   - Displaying Original String (5 marks)
   - Converting to Uppercase (10 marks)
   - Reversing the String (15 marks)
   - Counting Characters (10 marks)
4. Output Formatting (10 marks)
...
"""
rubric_parsed = parse_rubric(rubric)
print(rubric_parsed)
```

Remember to replace placeholders and adapt the code to your specific needs.  The fundamental changes necessary are far-reaching, requiring a redesign of the system architecture for better modularity, error handling, and robustness.


The provided code has a good foundation but needs improvements in the prompt design and class extraction logic to achieve a robust rubric scoring system.  Let's address the rubric's requirements one by one:


**1. Extract Class Method [6 marks]:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The `class_extraction_prompt` is flawed. It asks the LLM to extract classes from *both* student and model solutions simultaneously, but then separately invokes the prompt *twice*, once with only student code and once with only model code. This defeats the purpose of comparing the student code against the model solution within the prompt.  A much better approach would be to have a single prompt that explicitly compares and extracts classes from both simultaneously and instructs the LLM to return discrepancies if any.

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):**  The parsing is partially successful.  However, it currently doesn't handle the case where the LLM's response doesn't perfectly adhere to the expected `ClassExtraction` model.  Robust error handling is missing. The LLM might return unexpected formats, and the current code doesn't gracefully manage such scenarios. Additionally, the comment `# Ensure class names match between student and model` is commented out, which should not be the case.  It's crucial to verify that classes exist in both and check for name matches.

* **State Saving (1 mark):**  State saving using `state['student_classes']` and `state['model_classes']` is correctly implemented. (1 mark awarded)


**Improved `class_extraction_node` function:**

```python
def class_extraction_node(state: AgentState):
    student_code = state['student_code']
    model_solution = state['model_solution']

    improved_class_extraction_prompt = PromptTemplate(
        template="""
        Extract the class names and their code blocks from both the student's and model solutions.  
        Compare the class names. If they don't match, explicitly state the discrepancies.

        Student code:
        ```java
        {student_code}
        ```
        Model solution:
        ```java
        {model_solution}
        ```

        Return a JSON object with two lists: "student_classes" and "model_classes", each containing the class names.  Also include a "discrepancies" field listing any differences in class names.
        """,
        input_variables=["student_code", "model_solution"]
    )

    try:
        response = model.predict(improved_class_extraction_prompt.format(student_code=student_code, model_solution=model_solution))
        extracted_data = json.loads(response)  # assuming JSON response from LLM

        student_classes = extracted_data.get("student_classes", [])
        model_classes = extracted_data.get("model_classes", [])
        discrepancies = extracted_data.get("discrepancies", [])

        if discrepancies:
            state['evaluation'] = {"error": f"Class name discrepancies detected: {discrepancies}"}
        else:
            state['student_classes'] = student_classes
            state['model_classes'] = model_classes

    except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError) as e:
        state['evaluation'] = {"error": f"Error parsing LLM response: {e}"}

    return state

import json #import json for json.loads()
```

This revised function uses a single, improved prompt that directly compares student and model solutions.  It also includes robust error handling using a `try-except` block to catch potential issues with the LLM's JSON response.  The `json.loads()` function needs to be imported.


**Overall Score for Module 3:**

Given the improvements needed, a fair score for Module 3 would be around **4/6**.  The prompt design needs significant improvement (scoring 1-2 instead of 3),  parsing needs improvement (scoring 1 instead of 2), and the state saving works correctly (scoring 1).


To further enhance the rubric, consider:

* **More Sophisticated Class Comparison:**  Instead of just comparing class names, analyze the methods and their signatures within each class for a more thorough assessment.
* **LLM Chaining:** Instead of single prompts, chain prompts for more complex analysis and refined feedback.
* **Error Handling and Feedback:** Provide more informative error messages and feedback to the user when the LLM encounters issues or unexpected inputs.


Remember to adapt the prompts and code to handle variations in Java code style and structure to make the rubric more versatile and robust.


The code has a good foundation but needs improvements in prompt design and handling of LLM outputs to fully meet the rubric's requirements for Module 4.

**Issues and Improvements:**

1. **Prompt Design (rubric_prompt):** The `rubric_prompt` is insufficient.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on the *structure* of the desired JSON output. The LLM might produce a response that's difficult to parse reliably.  It should provide a clear JSON schema example.

   ```python
   rubric_prompt = PromptTemplate(
       template="""You are a grader matching student code to a grading rubric. 
       Here is the student's code: 

       {code} 

       Here is the rubric (including total marks): 

       {rubric} 

       Here is the model answer key:

       {model_answer_key}

       Match each part of the student's code with the rubric.  Provide structured JSON output like this:

       ```json
       [
           {"student_code_piece": "Class MyClass { ... }", "rubric_section": "Class Structure (10 marks)", "model_answer_key": "Class MyClass { ... model solution ...}"},
           {"student_code_piece": "methodA()", "rubric_section": "Method Functionality (5 marks)", "model_answer_key": "methodA() { ...model solution... }"}
       ]
       ```
       """,
       input_variables=["code", "rubric", "model_answer_key"]
   )
   ```

2. **Parsing/Output Extraction (rubric_extraction_module):**  The current parsing assumes the LLM *always* returns perfectly formatted JSON.  Robust error handling is missing. The LLM's output should be validated before being used.  Consider using a `try-except` block to handle JSON decoding errors and potential key errors.


   ```python
   def rubric_extraction_module(state: AgentState):
       # ... (rest of the function)

       try:
           structured_output = chain.invoke({
               "code": code,
               "rubric": rubric,
               "model_answer_key": model_answer_key
           })
           # Validate the output -  check if it's a list of dictionaries with the correct keys.
           if not isinstance(structured_output.mappings, list):
               raise ValueError("LLM output is not a list.")
           for item in structured_output.mappings:
               if not all(key in item for key in ["student_code_piece", "rubric_section", "model_answer_key"]):
                   raise ValueError("LLM output missing required keys.")

           state['rubric_mapping'] = [
               {
                   "student_code_piece": mapping.student_code_piece,
                   "rubric_section": mapping.rubric_section,
                   "model_answer_key": mapping.model_answer_key
               }
               for mapping in structured_output.mappings
           ]
       except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError) as e:
           print(f"Error parsing LLM output: {e}")
           state['rubric_mapping'] = []  # Handle the error appropriately
           #  Consider logging the error for debugging
       return state
   ```

3. **Class Extraction:** The `class_extraction_node` function sends an empty string for either `student_code` or `model_solution`.  This is likely incorrect.  It should send the complete code.

4. **State Saving:** The state is technically saved, but the structure of `rubric_mapping` in the `AgentState`  is a `List[RubricMappingEntry]` which should be consistently used throughout. The list comprehension within `rubric_extraction_module` is creating dictionaries, not `RubricMappingEntry` objects.


5. **`marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module`:** These are stubs. They need implementation to extract marks from the rubric based on the mappings and calculate the total marks.

6. **Error Handling:** The code lacks robust error handling.  Many things can go wrong (LLM failures, malformed JSON, etc.).  More `try-except` blocks are needed to handle these situations gracefully.



**Revised `rubric_extraction_module` (with error handling):**

```python
import json
# ... other imports

def rubric_extraction_module(state: AgentState):
    # ... (rest of the function)

    try:
        structured_output = chain.invoke({
            "code": code,
            "rubric": rubric,
            "model_answer_key": model_answer_key
        })
        # Validate the output - check if it's a list of dictionaries with the correct keys
        if not isinstance(structured_output.mappings, list):
            raise ValueError("LLM output is not a list.")
        for item in structured_output.mappings:
            if not all(key in item for key in ["student_code_piece", "rubric_section", "model_answer_key"]):
                raise ValueError("LLM output missing required keys.")

        state['rubric_mapping'] = [RubricMappingEntry(**mapping) for mapping in structured_output.mappings]  # Use RubricMappingEntry
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError, KeyError) as e:
        print(f"Error parsing LLM output or invalid output structure: {e}")
        state['rubric_mapping'] = []  # Handle error appropriately
        # Consider logging the error for debugging
    return state
```

By addressing these issues, the code will be more robust, reliable, and accurately reflect the intentions of the rubric.  Remember to implement the missing modules (`marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module`) and add comprehensive error handling throughout the code.


This code implements a sophisticated automated grading system using Langchain and OpenAI's LLM.  However, it has several areas that need improvement to fully meet the stated rubric and function correctly.

**Issues and Improvements:**

1. **Prompt Design (initial_evaluation_module):** The `evaluation_prompt` is good, but it relies heavily on a hardcoded `rubric_scores` dictionary. This makes it inflexible.  The rubric should be parsed to dynamically determine the max_score for each section.  The rubric itself should be analyzed to identify the sections and their associated points.


2. **Parsing/Output Extraction (All Modules):**  The code assumes the LLM will always return perfectly structured JSON.  Robust error handling is missing. The LLM responses should be validated and handled gracefully if they deviate from the expected format. This includes handling cases where the LLM fails to provide a response or provides an unexpected format.


3. **State Saving (All Modules):** The state is being passed correctly between functions. However, the `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are placeholders.  These need to be implemented to actually extract and calculate the total marks based on the `evaluation` data.


4. **Class Extraction (class_extraction_node):** The code attempts to extract classes separately from student and model solutions. This is inefficient and might lead to inaccurate comparisons if the class names aren't exactly the same but semantically equivalent.  It would be better to extract all classes from both and compare them in a more intelligent way, potentially using fuzzy matching or semantic similarity.


5. **Rubric Extraction (rubric_extraction_module):** This module relies on the LLM to parse the rubric and create mappings. This is prone to errors.  Consider a more structured approach where the rubric is parsed programmatically before passing information to the LLM, perhaps to just focus on the matching and scoring rather than parsing. The provided rubric in the test case doesn't follow a structure easy for the model to parse; it's more like a list. A structured format (e.g., JSON) would be far more reliable.


6. **LLM Model Selection:** The code uses `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4-0613`.  While `gpt-4-0613` might offer better performance for the evaluation tasks, its availability and cost should be considered.  Using a consistent model across all modules would be preferable.

7. **Error Handling:**  There is minimal error handling.  The code needs comprehensive error handling for LLM calls, file I/O, and data processing to ensure robustness.

8. **Efficiency:**  The code is somewhat inefficient because it calls the LLM multiple times.  Consider consolidating calls to reduce cost and latency. For example, the rubric extraction and evaluation could be combined into a single prompt.


**Revised `initial_evaluation_module` (with improved robustness and dynamic scoring):**

```python
def initial_evaluation_module(state: AgentState):
    # ... (import statements remain the same)

    evaluation_prompt = PromptTemplate(
        template="""
        You are an automated grading assistant. Evaluate the following student code segment based on the given rubric section.  The section is worth {max_score} points.

        Rubric Section: {rubric_section}
        Model Answer Key: {model_answer_key}
        Student Code: {student_code_piece}

        Provide a numeric score (out of {max_score}) for the rubric section.
        Include comments on the correctness of the implementation.
        Suggest improvements for the student's code.

        Structure your response in JSON format:
        {{"score": <int>, "comments": "<string>", "suggestions": "<string>"}}
        """,
        input_variables=["rubric_section", "model_answer_key", "student_code_piece", "max_score"]
    )

    # ... (StructuredEvaluation remains the same)

    evaluations = []
    total_score = 0

    for mapping in state['rubric_mapping']:
        # ... (rest of the function)

        # Extract score from LLM response with error handling
        try:
            evaluation = llm_evaluation.invoke(prompt_input)
            score = evaluation.score
            if not isinstance(score, int) or score < 0 or score > max_score:
                raise ValueError(f"Invalid score from LLM: {score}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error evaluating {mapping['rubric_section']}: {e}")  # Log the error
            score = 0  # Assign 0 if evaluation fails

        evaluations.append(EvaluationEntry(
            rubric_section=rubric_section,
            score=score,
            comments=evaluation.comments,
            suggestions=evaluation.suggestions
        ))
        total_score += score

    # ... (rest of the function remains similar)

```

This improved version adds error handling and dynamically gets the `max_score` from the rubric (which will need to be structured for this to work reliably).  Implementing robust parsing of the rubric and a more efficient LLM interaction strategy will require further significant changes to the code.  The `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module`  need to be completely filled in to complete the grading functionality.  Implementing proper testing would further improve the reliability and correctness of the system.


The code is a complex automated grading system using LangChain and OpenAI's LLM.  The `review_evaluation_module` is the focus of the rubric, specifically its prompt design, output parsing, and state saving. Let's evaluate it based on the provided rubric.

**4. Review Evaluation Method:**

* **Prompt Design (3 marks):** The prompt for reviewing evaluations (`review_prompt`) is well-structured. It clearly explains the task (reviewing initial evaluations), provides the necessary context (initial evaluations), and specifies the desired output format (JSON).  It's concise and avoids ambiguity.  It also handles potential exceptions well.  **Score: 3/3**

* **Parsing/Output Extraction (2 marks):** The module correctly extracts the `final_assessment` from the LLM's JSON response. It handles potential exceptions by providing a default value if the LLM call fails. The extraction logic correctly maps the LLM's structured output to the `FinalAssessmentEntry` model.  **Score: 2/2**

* **State Saving (1 mark):** The module correctly saves the `final_assessment` in the `state` dictionary.  This is crucial for the subsequent modules in the workflow.  **Score: 1/1**

**Total Score for Module 6: 6/6**


**Areas for Improvement (not affecting the score):**

* **Error Handling:** While exception handling is present, providing more specific error messages or logging could be beneficial for debugging and understanding failures.  Consider using a logging library like `logging`.

* **Prompt Engineering:** The prompt could be improved by adding examples of the expected JSON output or by providing more specific instructions on how to handle inconsistencies or missing information in the initial evaluations.  This could lead to more consistent and accurate LLM responses.

* **Rubric Score Calculation:**  The final rubric score isn't calculated. The `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are placeholders.  These need implementation to complete the grading process.

* **Class Name Extraction Robustness:** The class extraction relies on the LLM to correctly identify class names. There's no fallback mechanism if the LLM misinterprets the code.  Adding a more robust parser or incorporating static analysis could improve accuracy.

* **Dependency Management:** The code has several `import` statements scattered throughout. It would be better to consolidate them at the beginning of the file for better readability and maintainability.


The `review_evaluation_module` is well-implemented and effectively utilizes LangChain's features for structured output and exception handling.  The minor suggestions above are for enhancements and not critical flaws.


The provided code is a robust framework for automated code grading using LLMs. However, the `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are empty, which are crucial for the final grading.  Let's implement these missing modules and address the rubric's requirements.

**Prompt Design Improvements (for `initial_evaluation_module`):**

The `evaluation_prompt` is already well-structured.  However, consider adding a section to explicitly ask the LLM to justify its score:  "Explain your reasoning for the assigned score." This will improve transparency and allow for better debugging and review.

**Error Handling:**  The `initial_evaluation_module` already includes basic error handling. Consider adding more sophisticated error handling, perhaps logging errors to a file, and implementing retry mechanisms.


This enhanced code addresses the rubric's requirements and provides a more complete and functional automated code grading system. Remember to install the necessary libraries (`langchain`, `openai`, `pydantic`, `langgraph`).  Also, replace `"gpt-4o-mini"` and `"gpt-4-0613"` with appropriate model names based on your OpenAI API access.  The `test_class_extraction` function now better reflects the expected format of the rubric.  The `initial_evaluation` will need to be adjusted to accommodate the expected output structure for scoring to function properly in the `marks_extraction` module.  Remember to adapt the rubric scoring accordingly to match the rubric in your `initial_evaluation_module`  and ensure that the evaluation output has a `score` for each rubric section.

The provided code is a complex automated grading system using LangChain and OpenAI.  The `total_marks_calculation_module` is currently a `pass` statement, meaning the total marks aren't calculated. We need to implement this module to fulfill the rubric's requirement.  Furthermore, the prompt design for total marks calculation needs to be explicitly defined and integrated.

Here's the improved code with the `total_marks_calculation_module` implemented and a refined prompt design:


```python

total_marks_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""Calculate the total marks obtained by the student based on the individual rubric section scores.

        state['total_marks'] = total_marks
    except (ValueError, AttributeError):
        state['total_marks'] = 0  # Handle cases where extraction fails
        print("Error extracting total marks from LLM response. Setting total marks to 0.")
    return state

final_graph = graph.compile()

# ... (rest of the code remains the same) ...
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **`total_marks_calculation_module`:** This function now correctly extracts the `total_marks` from the state.

2. **`marks_extraction_module`:** This module is significantly enhanced. It now:
    - Processes the evaluation results to create a string suitable for the prompt.
    - Uses the `total_marks_prompt` to query the LLM for the total marks.
    - Includes robust error handling to gracefully handle cases where the LLM response is not as expected.  Setting a default value of 0 in case of failure prevents the program from crashing.

3. **Prompt Engineering:** A specific prompt `total_marks_prompt` is designed for calculating the total marks. This ensures that the LLM's task is clearly defined.

4. **Graph Modification:** The graph is updated to remove the now-redundant `total_marks_calculation` node and to direct the flow from `review_evaluation` directly to `marks_extraction` (which now handles total marks calculation).

This revised code addresses the rubric's requirements, providing a more robust and accurate total marks calculation.  Remember to install the necessary libraries (`langchain`, `openai`, `pydantic`).  Also, ensure your OpenAI API key is set correctly in the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.  The error handling is improved, but further refinement might be needed depending on the variations in the LLM's responses.


The code is mostly correct in its construction of the LangGraph, but has several areas for improvement and contains some errors that prevent it from fully functioning as intended. Let's break down the rubric assessment:

**7. Graph Construction [14 marks]**

* **Correct addition of nodes to the graph (5 marks):**  All modules are added as nodes.  **(5 marks)**

* **Correct addition of edges to the graph (5 marks):** All edges are correctly added, reflecting the intended workflow. **(5 marks)**

* **Correct compilation of graph (4 marks):** The graph is compiled using `graph.compile()`. However, there's a crucial problem:  The `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are empty functions.  This means that the graph compilation, while syntactically correct, will lead to incomplete execution, as these modules are essential for the final grading process.  This is a significant flaw and is a primary reason why the rubric wouldn't give the full 4 marks for this section.  **(2 marks)**  I'd give a lower score (0 marks) if the compilation wasn't even attempted.  However, since `compile` is called, I am giving 2 marks.

**Overall Graph Construction Score: 12/14**

**Further Issues and Improvements:**

1. **Empty Modules:** The `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are placeholders.  These need to be implemented to process the evaluation results and calculate the final score.  They should parse the data from `state['evaluation']` and `state['final_assessment']` to determine the total marks.

2. **Error Handling:** The `initial_evaluation_module` has a `try...except` block for error handling during LLM calls. This is good practice. More robust error handling should be added throughout the graph functions to prevent crashes and provide more informative error messages.

3. **LLM Model Selection:** The code uses both `"gpt-4o-mini"` and `"gpt-4-0613"`.  Consider standardizing to a single, appropriate model to maintain consistency and reduce potential variations in response quality.  Consider which model is best suited for the task at hand.

4. **Class Extraction Logic:**  The commented-out line `if sorted(student_classes) != sorted(model_classes):` suggests an intention to check for class name consistency between student and model solutions. This check should be uncommented and made functional.  Currently, the model doesn't enforce that the student provides the same classes as the model answer.

5. **Rubric Structure:** The rubric is hardcoded. Ideally, the rubric should be passed as input to the graph, allowing for flexibility and reusability.

6. **Output Clarity:** The `test_class_extraction` function prints the intermediate states (`pprint(s)`).  This makes debugging easier, but the final output should present the overall grade in a clear and concise manner.

7. **`sc.close()`:**  In the model solution, `sc.close()` is missing in the student code example, but present in the model solution.  This might lead to the LLM generating comparisons that aren't appropriate and potentially lead to the student losing marks unfairly.

**To improve the code significantly:**

1. **Implement `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module`:** These are crucial for a functioning grading system.

2. **Uncomment and fix the class name comparison:** Make sure the student's classes match the model solution's classes.

3. **Improve error handling:**  Add error handling where necessary to prevent unexpected failures.

4. **Refactor for modularity:** Create functions to extract data more easily from the LangChain responses (instead of multiple `for` loops).


By addressing these points, the code will become more robust, functional, and receive a much higher score on the rubric.


This code implements a sophisticated automated grading system using Langchain and OpenAI's GPT models.  Let's break down the code, identify improvements, and address potential issues.

**Strengths:**

* **Modular Design:** The code is well-structured into functions, making it readable and maintainable.  The use of a state graph (`StateGraph`) elegantly manages the workflow.
* **Structured Output:**  Utilizing `with_structured_output` ensures the LLM responses are parsed into Python objects, reducing the need for complex string parsing.  This significantly improves robustness.
* **Error Handling:**  The `try...except` blocks in `initial_evaluation_module` and `review_evaluation_module` handle potential LLM errors gracefully, preventing crashes.
* **Type Hinting:**  Extensive use of type hinting (`typing`, `pydantic`) enhances code readability and helps catch errors early.
* **Secure API Key Handling:**  The `_set_env` function securely retrieves the OpenAI API key from the user.
* **Clear Prompt Engineering:** The prompts are well-written and guide the LLM effectively.


**Weaknesses and Improvements:**

1. **`class_extraction_node` Inconsistency:** The function extracts classes from both student and model code separately, but the comment `# if sorted(student_classes) != sorted(model_classes):` is never used.  This comparison should be implemented to ensure the LLM correctly identifies classes.  If they don't match, an error should be properly raised and handled (perhaps by returning an error state to the graph).

2. **Incomplete Modules:** `marks_extraction_module` and `total_marks_calculation_module` are placeholders.  These are crucial for the system's functionality and need to be implemented.  `marks_extraction_module` should extract the marks from the `final_assessment` (which currently has no score associated with the class). `total_marks_calculation_module` should sum the final scores for all classes.

3. **Rubric Handling:** The rubric is currently a string.  Parsing the rubric into a structured format (e.g., a dictionary or list of dictionaries) would make the rubric section mapping and scoring more robust and efficient.  Regular expressions or a dedicated rubric parsing library could be used for this purpose.

4. **Hardcoded Rubric Scores:** The `rubric_scores` dictionary in `initial_evaluation_module` hardcodes the points for each rubric section.  This should be extracted from the structured rubric representation mentioned above.

5. **LLM Choice:** Using `gpt-4o-mini` and `gpt-4-0613` for different parts might not be ideal due to cost and minor model differences.  Consider standardizing to a single, appropriate model.  Also check for newer models.

6. **Large Language Model (LLM) Cost:**  The system is designed to run potentially several prompts per student assignment. This could be expensive depending on the number of students.  Consider optimizing prompts to minimize the cost.


**Revised Code (with key improvements):**

This revised code addresses some of the above points, focusing on the most critical improvements:


```python
# ... (imports and _set_env remain the same)

# ... (RubricMappingEntry, RubricMapping, AgentState remain the same)

# ... (model initialization remains the same)

# ... (ClassExtraction and class_extraction_prompt remain the same)

# Function to extract class names and code blocks (improved)
def class_extraction_node(state: AgentState):
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same except for the improved error handling)

    if sorted(student_classes) != sorted(model_classes):
        state['evaluation'] = {"error": "Class names do not match between student submission and model solution."}
        return state

    #Update the state
    state['student_classes'] = student_classes
    state['model_classes'] = model_classes

    return state

# ... (llm_rubric_with_structured_output remains the same)

# ... (rubric_extraction_module remains largely the same)

# ...(initial_evaluation_module remains largely the same)


# Function to review the evaluation (Improved to extract final score)
def review_evaluation_module(state: AgentState):
    # ... (prompt remains the same)

    # ... (LLM invocation remains the same)

    state['final_assessment'] = [
        {
            "class_name": fa.class_name,
            "final_comments": fa.final_comments,
            "final_score": fa.final_score  #Extract final score
        } for fa in final_assessment.final_assessment
    ]

    return state


# Added marks and total marks calculation modules
def marks_extraction_module(state: AgentState):
    final_scores = [entry['final_score'] for entry in state['final_assessment']]
    state['final_scores'] = final_scores
    return state


def total_marks_calculation_module(state: AgentState):
    total_marks = sum(state['final_scores'])
    state['total_marks'] = total_marks
    return state

# ... (graph building remains the same)

# ... (test_class_extraction remains the same except pprint should be removed or changed to a different method)

```

Remember to implement a more robust rubric parsing method and handle potential exceptions more comprehensively.  Consider logging to track the system's behavior during execution.  Thorough testing with various student code samples is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the grading system.
