## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 42/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [5/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt design effectively instructs the LLM to extract individual Java classes, including class names and code.  It's clear and concise.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The `parse_extracted_classes` function correctly parses the LLM output and extracts the individual classes. The improved regex in the student solution handles various class declarations more robustly.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not saved to state variables (`extracted_classes`).  The code attempts to populate the dictionary, but the `state['extracted_classes'] = classes` line is absent.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [6/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt is well-designed and includes the necessary rubric and class name information.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The rubric details are correctly extracted from the LLM's response.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are properly saved in the `extracted_rubrics` state variable.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [6/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt is properly structured and provides the student code, model solution, and rubric information to the LLM.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The function correctly extracts both detailed evaluations and numeric scores.

**3.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The evaluation results are saved appropriately within the `initial_evaluations` state variable.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [6/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt efficiently guides the LLM to review and correct the initial evaluations.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are extracted correctly.

**4.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The reviewed evaluations are correctly saved to `final_evaluations` in the state.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [5/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt effectively instructs the LLM to extract marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The `re.findall` is improved to extract numeric marks correctly.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
Similar to module 1, the extracted marks are not saved to the state. The line `state['extracted_marks'][class_name] = ",".join(numeric_marks)` is missing.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  
The prompt correctly uses the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  
The final sum is extracted correctly.

**6.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The final total marks are properly saved in the `total_marks` state variable.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All modules are correctly added as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All edges are correctly defined and reflect the workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles without errors, indicating proper workflow structure.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a strong understanding of LangGraph and LLM integration. The code is well-structured and mostly functional. The major areas for improvement are in state management; several crucial lines of code that save the results of LLM calls into state variables are missing, causing the program to not produce the required final output.  Addressing this will complete the application.
