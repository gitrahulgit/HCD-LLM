## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 26/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [4/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt attempts to extract classes but doesn't explicitly specify the desired output format, making parsing more challenging.  It also lacks a clear instruction to handle multiple classes within the submission.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The code partially extracts classes, but the method used is inefficient and prone to errors if class declarations are not consistently formatted.  It does not properly handle nested classes or complex class structures.


**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:** Extracted class information is successfully saved to the `state` variable.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing entirely.  No prompt is designed to extract rubric details for each class.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  No rubric extraction is attempted.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  No state saving for rubric details is performed.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.  No prompt is designed to evaluate class code against the rubric and model solution.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No evaluation is performed.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving for initial evaluations is done.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No review of evaluations is performed.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving for reviewed evaluations.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is not implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No marks are extracted.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving of extracted marks.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No total marks calculation.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving of total marks.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:** All modules are correctly added as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** All edges are correctly defined and connect the nodes sequentially.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:** The graph is compiled successfully.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph's workflow capabilities by constructing a correct graph structure. However, crucial modules for rubric extraction, initial and review evaluations, marks extraction, and total marks calculation are missing. The class extraction module needs significant improvement in prompt design and output parsing to handle varied code structures. Focus on completing the missing modules and refining the class extraction logic.
