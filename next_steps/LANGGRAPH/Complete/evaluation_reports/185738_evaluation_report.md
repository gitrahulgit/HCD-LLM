## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The student did not provide a prompt for class extraction.  The code attempts to use an LLM but lacks a well-defined prompt to guide the LLM in extracting classes.  No marks awarded.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
While there's an attempt to parse the output (using a function called `parse_extracted_classes`), the function does not seem to successfully perform extraction of classes from the LLM's response.  Partial credit given for the function's existence.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The code does not effectively save the extracted class information to state variables for further use in the workflow.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt for rubric extraction is defined in the code.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No rubric extraction logic is implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for rubric details.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt is designed for initial evaluation.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
There is no mechanism to parse and extract scores and comments.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for initial evaluations.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt is provided for reviewing evaluations.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code for extracting reviewed evaluations.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for reviewed evaluations.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt for mark extraction.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code for extracting marks.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for extracted marks.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The `sum_marks` function is defined, but it is not used in conjunction with an LLM prompt within the workflow to calculate the total marks.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
The final sum is not extracted.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The final marks are not saved.

#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All modules are added as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All edges are correctly defined between nodes in the workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compilation is mostly correct, but lacks the necessary input data handling and proper LLM interaction.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph's structure by creating a workflow graph with nodes and edges.  However, the crucial aspect of LLM interaction, including prompt design and output parsing, is missing or incomplete in most modules. The student needs to focus on developing effective prompts for LLMs and implementing robust parsing logic to extract relevant information from LLM responses.  Consider reviewing the model solution and closely following the rubric's criteria for each module.
