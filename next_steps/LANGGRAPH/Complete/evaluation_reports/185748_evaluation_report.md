## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [4/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract classes but lacks specificity.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to output the class name and code in a structured format (e.g., JSON), making parsing more challenging.  The use of two separate prompts would have been more efficient and clarified the expected output format.


**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM output, however the parsing logic is not robust enough to handle variations in the LLM's response.  It assumes a very specific format.  A more flexible approach (e.g., regular expressions) is needed to handle unpredictable LLM outputs.


**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
Extracted class information is correctly saved into the state variable.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt is reasonably designed. It attempts to guide the LLM to extract the relevant rubric details but could be more precise by specifying the expected output format and structure.


**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code simply uses the raw LLM output without any parsing or processing, making it susceptible to errors if the LLM's output isn't perfectly formatted.


**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The rubric details are not saved correctly into the state variable.



#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [3/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt structure is acceptable, including the student code, model solution, and rubric. However, it could benefit from clearer instructions on the desired format for the evaluation response (scores, comments).


**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code uses the raw LLM response without any parsing.  The extraction of scores and comments needs improvement to reliably handle different formats from the LLM.


**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The initial evaluation results are not saved correctly.



#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [3/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt for reviewing the evaluation is adequate, but it could be improved by providing more specific instructions for making corrections and highlighting the aspects that need special attention.


**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Like the previous modules, the code lacks parsing of the LLM's response, leaving the results vulnerable to formatting variations.


**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The reviewed evaluation isn't saved to the state properly.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [3/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt guides the LLM towards extracting marks, but it could be improved by specifying the expected comma-separated format explicitly.


**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The attempt to extract marks uses regular expressions but doesn't reliably handle potential formatting problems in the LLM's output.  The handling of errors in extraction is inadequate.


**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
Marks are not saved to the state variable.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The `sum_marks` tool is not utilized in the student's solution.


**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks are extracted, therefore no sum is calculated.


**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
Final marks are not saved.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All modules are correctly added as nodes.


**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All edges between nodes are added correctly and the feedback loop is included.


**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compilation is implemented correctly.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph's structure and successfully builds a workflow graph with nodes and edges. However, the implementation suffers from a lack of robust parsing of LLM outputs and error handling.  The student needs to focus on designing more specific prompts and implementing robust parsing mechanisms to handle variations in LLM responses to improve accuracy and reliability.  The total marks calculation module was entirely missing.
