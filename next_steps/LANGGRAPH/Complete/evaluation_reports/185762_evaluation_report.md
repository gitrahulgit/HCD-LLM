## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks the precision needed for robust extraction from varied Java code structures.  It relies on a simple regex, which is insufficient for complex class declarations or nested classes.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The parsing uses a basic regular expression, which will fail to extract classes correctly if the input code deviates from simple class structures (e.g., nested classes, complex inheritance).  The output relies on successful parsing which is unreliable.


**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:** The extracted classes are saved to the state variable `extracted_classes`, which is correct implementation.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [4/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt design shows an attempt to extract rubric details. However, it doesn't directly address the need to extract rubric information specific to each class.  The prompt is generally reasonable but insufficient for complex rubrics.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  The parsing successfully extracts rubric segments using regular expressions. While the method shows understanding of the task, the regex is simplistic and prone to failure with differently structured rubrics.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The extracted rubric details are not saved into the state variable correctly; they should be saved to a dictionary indexed by class name.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  This module is missing entirely.  No prompt design is present for evaluating class code.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  No attempt made to parse or extract scores and comments.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving is performed, as the module is not implemented.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing entirely.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  No attempt to extract reviewed evaluations.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  No state saving for reviewed evaluations.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No marks extraction is attempted.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No marks are saved in state.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing entirely.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No attempt made to extract the final sum.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No final marks are saved.

#### 7. Graph Construction [7/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [3/5]:** Only a few nodes are added correctly, several critical modules are missing.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [2/5]:** The edges between the existing nodes are mostly correct.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [2/4]:** The graph compilation is partially correct, but the absence of significant nodes compromises the overall workflow.

---

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph and state management.  However, significant portions of the required functionality are missing, particularly the core LLM-based evaluation modules. The use of regex for class extraction and rubric parsing shows some effort but is not robust enough for a real-world application. The student should focus on completing the missing modules and implementing more reliable parsing techniques, potentially using LLMs for more sophisticated extraction.  Furthermore, the integration of the `sum_marks` tool is completely absent.
