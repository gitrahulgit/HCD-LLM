## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The student's approach uses a generic prompt for class extraction that doesn't specify extracting only Java classes, nor does it handle potential complexities in Java code structure effectively.  The prompt lacks the specifics needed for reliable parsing of Java code.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
While the student attempts to parse the output, the parsing logic is rudimentary and susceptible to errors in the LLM's response. The method only extracts information based on the presence of 'class', potentially misinterpreting other lines.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not saved to any state variable, a crucial element for LangGraph's workflow.  The implementation lacks the mechanisms for passing data between LangGraph nodes.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing from the student's submission. No attempt has been made to extract rubric details for individual classes.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is entirely missing from the student's submission.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is entirely missing from the student's submission.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. No prompt has been designed for the evaluation of the extracted classes.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is missing.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is missing.

#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student successfully added nodes for several steps of the workflow, although many are incomplete or missing functionality.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The connections between the nodes in the LangGraph are mostly correct, reflecting a basic understanding of workflow construction.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The student attempts to compile the graph, but without implementation of the required nodes, the graph is not functional.  The `create_langgraph_workflow` function creates the graph structure, showing an attempt at using the `StateGraph` but the missing methods prevent the successful compilation.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph's structure by creating a graph and connecting nodes, but lacks the critical components of proper prompt engineering and robust parsing of LLM outputs.  Focus on improving prompt design for accurate extraction of classes, rubric details, and evaluations. Implement missing modules and enhance parsing logic to handle varied LLM responses effectively.  The graph construction shows promise but needs functional nodes to be complete.
