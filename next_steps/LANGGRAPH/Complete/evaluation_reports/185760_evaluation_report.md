## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [4/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt design attempts to extract classes using a JSON format, which is a good approach for structured output. However, it could be improved by explicitly stating the expected format and including examples of both valid and invalid outputs to guide the LLM more effectively.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** The student successfully parses the JSON output from the LLM to extract the class names and code.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The extracted class information is not saved to the state variables for subsequent use; hence no marks are awarded here.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt design is reasonably structured but lacks specific instructions on how to handle multiple criteria within a rubric.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The student successfully parses JSON output but could improve error handling.


**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The extracted rubric details are not stored in the state for further use.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [3/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  The prompt structure is acceptable, however, it does not explicitly mention the expected output format (JSON).

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** Partial extraction of scores and comments.  The output structure is not strictly enforced.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  The evaluation results are not saved properly to the state for subsequent processing.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing entirely.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** This module is missing entirely.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:** This module is missing entirely.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [3/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt attempts to extract marks, but it doesn't specify the desired output format, leading to potential ambiguities.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The student implemented a simplified method to extract marks but this part is not fully implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving is implemented.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [3/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt for total marks calculation is partially implemented.  However, there is no explicit mention of how to obtain the marks.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The final sum is extracted but not correctly.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  The final marks are not saved properly into the state.


#### 7. Graph Construction [12/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:** All modules are present as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** All edges between modules are correctly connected.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [2/4]:** The graph compilation is partially correct, but lacks a comprehensive approach, hence only partial marks are awarded.



---

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangChain and prompt engineering but needs to improve on state management within the LangGraph framework.  The submission is incomplete in several key modules and requires a greater focus on the structured output format (JSON) and consistent use of state variables.  Implement missing modules (review_evaluation), ensure complete parsing of LLM responses and robust state management for a better score.
