## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes but doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM to return them in a structured format suitable for easy parsing.  This makes subsequent parsing more difficult and error-prone.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code doesn't include any parsing of the LLM's output for class extraction.  The raw LLM response is stored in the state without any processing to separate class names from code.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
While the code attempts to store information in the state, it relies on unstructured strings from the LLM, making it difficult to use this data in subsequent steps.  No structured representation of extracted classes is saved.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract rubric details but lacks specificity on the desired output format.  A more structured output would significantly improve the subsequent steps.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Similar to class extraction, the rubric extraction doesn't parse the LLM's output.  The raw text is saved, making it hard to utilize in the evaluation.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The rubric details are saved in the state, but in a raw, unstructured format which prevents efficient use in later modules.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [3/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design is acceptable, including student and instructor classes, and rubric details. However, clearer instructions on the desired output format for the evaluation would improve its structure.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The output of the initial evaluation is not parsed.  The unstructured LLM response is stored directly, making subsequent processing challenging.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State saving is attempted, but the unstructured nature of the stored data limits its usefulness in later stages of the workflow.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [3/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt is well-formed and correctly guides the LLM towards reviewing the initial evaluation.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The LLM output is not parsed.  A structured approach is necessary to process and extract relevant information.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State saving is present but ineffective due to the absence of output parsing.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [3/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt design aims to extract marks, but lacks specificity in the expected output format (e.g., comma-separated values).

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
There is no parsing implemented, leading to raw LLM output being stored without extraction of specific mark values.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State saving is present but not useful without proper parsing of extracted marks.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [3/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The `sum_marks` function is not used within the LangGraph framework as intended.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [3/2]:** The code successfully sums the marks if provided in a correctly formatted string.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The total marks are stored correctly, provided the input is correctly formatted.

#### 7. Graph Construction [0/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [0/5]:**  
The student submission doesn't use a LangGraph framework. The code uses a linear sequence of functions instead of a graph-based workflow.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [0/5]:**  
No graph structure is present; therefore, no edges are defined.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [0/4]:**  
The provided code does not compile a LangGraph.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of using LLMs for code evaluation, but lacks implementation of proper parsing and structured state management, which are crucial for a robust LangGraph application. Focus on structured data handling and output parsing to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the evaluation process. The missing LangGraph implementation is a significant shortcoming.
