## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 38/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [5/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:** The prompt design is well-structured and includes all necessary elements for class extraction.  It effectively instructs the LLM to extract individual Java classes along with their names and code.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The parsing of the LLM output is partially correct. While the code extracts classes successfully from the student code, it does not correctly extract classes from the model solution because the variable `state['model_solution']` was improperly used in the function `class_extraction`.  There is no error handling, leading to the code failing to process the model solution in this section.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:** Extracted class information is correctly saved into the `extracted_classes` state variable.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [6/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:**  The prompt efficiently passes relevant rubric elements to the LLM for each class, requesting that it only extract the details pertinent to that class.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** Rubric details are correctly extracted from the LLM output for each class and stored appropriately.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:** Rubric details are saved correctly using state variables for subsequent nodes in the workflow.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [5/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:** The prompt design is good, clearly instructing the LLM to evaluate the student code against the rubric and model solution. It requests detailed feedback, including scores and comments.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The extraction of scores and comments from the LLM response is incomplete.  There's no reliable mechanism for extracting only the scores.

**3.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  The evaluation results are appropriately saved in the state.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [6/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:** The prompt is effectively structured to guide the LLM in reviewing and correcting the initial evaluations, ensuring accuracy and completeness.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** The reviewed evaluations are correctly extracted from the LLM's response.

**4.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  Reviewed evaluations are saved correctly within the state.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [4/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:** The prompt design is adequate for instructing the LLM to extract marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  The parsing of marks is incomplete and unreliable. The regular expression used (`re.findall(r'\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b', result.content)`) only captures numbers and does not account for the comma separated structure expected in the output. This led to incorrect extraction of marks.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The marks were not reliably extracted, and hence, no marks could be saved for the total marks calculation step.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [5/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:** The prompt correctly utilizes the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** The final sum is correctly extracted once the sum is available.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:** Due to problems in marks extraction, the final total marks could not be saved.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:** All modules are correctly added as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** All edges between the modules are correctly defined.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:** The graph is compiled without errors and the workflow runs successfully.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph and LLM integration, successfully creating the workflow and connecting the nodes appropriately.  However, the code's reliability is hampered by incomplete parsing and missing error handling in several crucial modules (class extraction and marks extraction).  Focus on robust parsing of LLM outputs, incorporating comprehensive error checks to improve the code's accuracy and robustness.  Also, careful consideration should be given to the formatting of the LLM prompts to ensure accurate and complete output extraction.
