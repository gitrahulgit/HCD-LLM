## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes, but it lacks specificity. It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on the desired output format (e.g., JSON, a list of class names).  The prompt also doesn't account for variations in class declaration formats which may exist in the code.  The use of a problem description might confuse the LLM further.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
The code doesn't effectively parse the LLM's response. There's no mechanism to extract class names or code reliably from the potentially free-form text returned by the LLM.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not saved into the state variables; it's not directly used in the workflow.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is entirely missing.

#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The graph includes nodes for "agent" and "generate", representing the intended workflow elements.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges correctly connect the START node to "agent", "agent" to "generate", and "generate" to END, showing a logical flow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph is compiled using `workflow.compile()`, which demonstrates appropriate graph construction. A minor deduction because the model solution shows additional nodes.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a basic understanding of LangGraph by creating a simple workflow with nodes and edges. However, the core functionality of evaluating code is largely missing. The class extraction attempts are rudimentary, lacking robust parsing and state management. The student needs to implement all the other modules following the model solution and refine the prompt design and output parsing for a more complete and functional solution.  Focus on improving the prompt design and output parsing to achieve full functionality.
