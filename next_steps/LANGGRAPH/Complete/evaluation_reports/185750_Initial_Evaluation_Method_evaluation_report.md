## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract classes, but it lacks specific instructions for handling multiple classes and formatting the output consistently.  It needs to explicitly ask for a structured output (e.g., JSON) separating class names and code.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM output, but the parsing logic is rudimentary and assumes a simple structure which is not always present in the LLM's response.  It fails to reliably extract all classes in cases where the LLM's response structure isn't perfectly predictable.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted classes are not saved properly within the LangGraph state. The solution lacks the necessary state management to pass extracted classes to subsequent stages.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.  No prompt is designed for rubric extraction.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No rubric extraction parsing implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for rubric information.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing implemented.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing implemented.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing implemented.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes representing each step in the workflow.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly connected the nodes to form a sequential workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The student successfully compiled the LangGraph.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a good understanding of LangGraph's structure and node connection. However, the core logic for interacting with the LLM (prompt design, output parsing, and state management) needs significant improvement.  Focus on creating robust prompts that elicit structured JSON responses from the LLM and implement reliable parsing mechanisms to extract relevant data.  Improving these areas will greatly enhance the functionality and accuracy of the application.
