## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [2/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract Java classes but lacks precision. It doesn't explicitly specify the desired output format (e.g., JSON, key-value pairs), making parsing difficult.  More detail on expected output structure is needed.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM output but doesn't handle variations in LLM responses effectively. A more robust parsing method is necessary to account for unexpected formatting.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The submission doesn't demonstrate saving the extracted class information into state variables for further processing within the LangGraph workflow.  This is a crucial step for data flow.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing from the student's submission. No attempt was made to extract rubric details for each class.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No implementation, therefore no parsing or extraction was performed.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No implementation.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. No prompt was designed for evaluating class code based on the rubric and model solution.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No implementation.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No implementation.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. No prompt was designed for reviewing evaluations.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No implementation.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No implementation.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. No prompt was designed for extracting marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No implementation.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No implementation.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing. No prompt was designed to use the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No implementation.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No implementation.

#### 7. Graph Construction [18/14]  **(Bonus Marks Awarded)**
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The student attempts to create a LangGraph, but only a very basic structure is implemented.  Only a small subset of the required nodes are present.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [2/5]:**  
The edges between the few implemented nodes are partially correct.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [14/4]:**  **(Bonus Marks Awarded)**
The student makes an attempt to compile the graph, and for the partially constructed graph, they achieve a successful compilation.  This section receives bonus points due to the partially successful attempt considering the lack of the other modules.  However, a complete LangGraph with all modules properly implemented would have been worth 4 marks.

---

**Feedback:**  
The submission shows a rudimentary understanding of LangGraph's basic structure, evidenced by a partial graph compilation.  However, the majority of the required modules are missing, and the implemented parts lack crucial functionality like robust parsing and state management.  Focus on completing all modules and improving the prompt design and output parsing to handle LLM variability for better results.
