## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The student's code attempts to extract classes but lacks a properly defined prompt.  The prompt is not designed to extract class definitions in a structured way, making the output parsing extremely difficult.  There's no clear separation between prompting for student code and model solution.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
While the code attempts to parse the LLM output, it relies on a simplistic approach that is heavily dependent on the exact format of the LLM's response.  This makes it unreliable and fragile. The parsing only works if the LLM response matches the expected format exactly, which is not guaranteed.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not properly saved to state variables for later use in the workflow.  There's no evidence of state management within the `extract` function.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No rubric extraction method is implemented.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No rubric extraction method is implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No rubric extraction method is implemented.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No initial evaluation method is implemented.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No initial evaluation method is implemented.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No initial evaluation method is implemented.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No review evaluation method is implemented.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No review evaluation method is implemented.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No review evaluation method is implemented.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks extraction method is implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks extraction method is implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No marks extraction method is implemented.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No total marks calculation method is implemented.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No total marks calculation method is implemented.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No total marks calculation method is implemented.

#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All modules are present as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All edges between nodes are correctly implemented.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compilation is mostly correct, however, the workflow does not fully execute as intended due to significant missing functionality in other modules.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a good understanding of LangGraph's graph construction and node linking.  However, the core functionality for LLM prompting, parsing, and state management within each evaluation module is missing or incomplete. Focus on improving prompt design and output parsing to correctly extract and process LLM responses, ensuring robust data handling and state management for the evaluation workflow.  The chosen LLM model and key are also unavailable for testing.
