## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The student attempts to use OpenAI's API for class extraction, but the code is outdated and uses deprecated methods (`openai.Completion`). The prompt itself is not evaluated because the code does not run.  It would have needed to include instructions to extract class names and their code separately.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
The parsing function is not executed due to the API error. Therefore, no marks are awarded.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
Although the class extraction fails, the code attempts to save the extracted class information into the state variable `state['extracted_classes']`. This shows a basic understanding of state management.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The rubric extraction module uses an outdated OpenAI API call and therefore fails to execute. The prompt is not assessed.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing happens due to the API error.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving occurs because the module does not run.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The code uses the outdated OpenAI API, preventing execution and rendering prompt evaluation impossible.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing occurs due to the API error.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving takes place because the module does not execute.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The module is not executed due to prior errors.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing happens due to the API call error.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
There is no state saving in this module due to the non-execution of the code.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The module doesn't run due to previous errors, so the prompt is not evaluated.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks are awarded due to the failed API call.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The non-execution of the code results in no state saving.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The module is skipped due to preceding errors.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
Due to the error in prior modules, this module does not execute.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
There is no state saving because the module does not run.


#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All modules are added as nodes to the graph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The connections between modules (nodes) are correctly established.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph is compiled, but there's a warning about adding nodes to an already compiled graph, indicating a potential issue in the code structure.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph's workflow structure by correctly constructing the graph. However, the core functionality of interacting with the OpenAI API fails due to using outdated API methods. The student should update the OpenAI library and migrate to the correct API calls before focusing on prompt engineering and other functionalities.  Addressing the API issue is the top priority for improvement.
