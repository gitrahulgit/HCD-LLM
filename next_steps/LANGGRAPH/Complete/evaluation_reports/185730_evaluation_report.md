## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [4/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt attempts to extract classes but lacks specificity.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on the expected output format (e.g., JSON, key-value pairs), leading to less reliable parsing.  The prompt should be more precise regarding the desired output structure.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The student's code attempts to parse the LLM output, but it's a rudimentary approach that may not be robust enough for various LLM responses.  It relies on simple string manipulation and lacks error handling, making it prone to failure if the LLM's output deviates from expected formatting.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:** The extracted class information is successfully saved into a dictionary within the state variable.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is completely missing. No attempt was made to design or implement a prompt to extract rubric details for each class.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  No parsing or extraction occurred due to the absence of the module.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving was implemented for this missing module.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  This module is also missing, thus no prompt design.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No parsing or extraction of scores and comments, because the module is missing.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  No state saving for this missing module.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No extraction occurred due to the absence of the module.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving was implemented for this missing module.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No marks were extracted because the module is absent.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving for this missing module.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [6/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [3/3]:** The prompt design for using the `sum_marks` tool is correct.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** The final sum is correctly extracted from the LLM response.

**6.3. State Saving [1/1]:** Final marks are saved properly within the state.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:** All modules are added as nodes (although some are empty).

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** All edges are correctly placed between the nodes, reflecting the intended workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:** The graph is correctly compiled.

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrated a basic understanding of LangGraph's structure by constructing a functional graph with properly connected nodes and edges. However, the significant omission of several crucial modules (Rubric Extraction, Initial Evaluation, Review Evaluation, and Marks Extraction) severely limits the functionality of the application.  The student should focus on implementing these missing components, ensuring proper prompt engineering and robust output parsing for each module. Improving the robustness of class extraction parsing would also be beneficial.
