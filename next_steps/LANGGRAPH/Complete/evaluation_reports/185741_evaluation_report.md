## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks the sophistication to handle complex Java code structures reliably. It would benefit from more specific instructions on class identification within the context of Java code.


**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
The parsing and output extraction are completely missing. The student code doesn't process the LLM's response to identify and separate individual classes.


**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
Since no classes were extracted, state saving for this module is not implemented.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing from the student's implementation.


**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing or extraction is performed as the module is absent.


**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The module is not implemented, hence no state is saved.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing in the student's solution.


**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction takes place since the module is not implemented.


**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
State saving is not implemented because the module is absent.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The module is not present in the student's code.


**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing occurs as the module is missing.


**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
There is no state saving due to the absence of the module.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented by the student.


**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing is attempted because the module is absent.


**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is present as the module is not implemented.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing from the submission.


**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
Since this module is not implemented, no parsing occurs.


**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
There is no state saving because the module is not implemented.


#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes to represent the modules, although many are not functional.  


**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The connections between the nodes are correctly implemented in the graph structure.


**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compilation is partially successful.  There are errors due to the missing functionality of the majority of the nodes.

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrated a basic understanding of LangGraph by constructing the workflow graph structure. However, the implementation of the core evaluation modules is severely lacking.  Focus on completing the missing modules, starting with robust prompt engineering and output parsing for the class extraction module.  Pay close attention to the provided model solution for guidance.  Consider breaking down each module into smaller, manageable parts.
