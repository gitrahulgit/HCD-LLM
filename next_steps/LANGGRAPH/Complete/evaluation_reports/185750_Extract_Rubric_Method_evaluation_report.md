## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt attempts to extract classes but lacks precision.  It doesn't explicitly specify the desired output format or handle potential variations in class declarations.  A more structured prompt with examples would improve accuracy.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM's output, but the parsing logic is incomplete and prone to errors if the LLM's response deviates from the expected format.  Error handling is missing.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted classes are saved in the state as intended.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is entirely missing from the student's solution.  No prompt design is present.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction logic is present.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is implemented.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing or extraction is present.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state management is implemented.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction logic is present.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is present.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction logic is implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is implemented.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction of the final sum is implemented.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No saving of final marks is implemented.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added nodes to the graph for class extraction and other related stages.  

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student added edges correctly to establish workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compiles successfully, indicating proper construction of the LangGraph.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph's structure and workflow.  The graph construction is well-executed, showing proficiency in connecting nodes and edges. However, the core functionality of prompt engineering and LLM interaction is lacking.  Focus on improving prompt design, output parsing, and error handling for each module to achieve a fully functional solution.  The submission lacks crucial modules (2-6).  A step-by-step implementation using the model solution would greatly benefit the studentâ€™s understanding.
