## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The prompt design is inadequate. It attempts to extract classes but lacks the specific formatting instructions required for reliable parsing.  The prompt does not explicitly instruct the LLM on how to format the output to make it easily parsable.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The code attempts to parse the LLM output. However, due to the poor prompt design, the parsing is unreliable and likely to fail in many cases.  Only a minimal level of parsing is implemented.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not saved to state variables.  There is no mechanism for persisting the extracted class information.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented. No prompt is designed for rubric extraction.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No attempt is made to parse or extract rubric details.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving is implemented for rubric details.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented. No prompt is designed for initial evaluation.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing of initial evaluations is attempted.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for initial evaluations is implemented.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented. No prompt for reviewing evaluations is provided.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing of reviewed evaluations is performed.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for reviewed evaluations exists.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.  No prompt is created for extracting marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks are extracted.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for extracted marks is present.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented. The `sum_marks` tool is not used.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No final sum is extracted.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for the final total marks.


#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
Although the graph is not implemented using LangGraph as requested, the student code has some code blocks that represent the modular structure which could be adapted into LangGraph nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The sequential structure of async calls is functionally equivalent to edges in a directed graph.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The code does not use LangGraph's compilation mechanism.  While the modular structure is present, it's not compiled as a LangGraph.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of using LLMs for code analysis. The code attempts to break down the evaluation into modules, although it doesn't use LangGraph as requested.  Significant improvements are needed in prompt engineering and implementing missing modules to achieve the project's goals.  Focus on precise prompt design and state management within LangGraph's framework for a successful implementation.
