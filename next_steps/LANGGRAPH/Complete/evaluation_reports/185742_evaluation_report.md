## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks specificity in handling diverse Java code structures.  It doesn't account for nested classes or complex import statements, potentially leading to incomplete extraction.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The parsing attempts to extract classes, but the implementation is rudimentary. It doesn't robustly handle varied class declarations or comments within the code.  

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  The extracted class information is saved to the state variables as intended, thus enabling the flow of information to the subsequent stages of the process.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt is reasonably structured to extract rubric details, however, it assumes a specific JSON format which might not be universally applicable.  Improvements could be made to handle different rubric formatting.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The code correctly parses and extracts the rubric data from the specified JSON file, but additional error handling for file reading could be added.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The rubric information is not correctly saved into the state for further use.  The rubric is loaded at the beginning, but not passed through the LangGraph process.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  This module is missing entirely.  No prompt design for initial evaluation is provided.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No parsing or extraction is performed due to the absence of the initial evaluation module.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving occurs as the module is missing.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  This module is also missing.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No parsing or extraction occurs.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving is implemented.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  No marks extraction is implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving is done.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** No total marks extraction is performed.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  No state saving is done.


#### 7. Graph Construction [19/14]  **(Bonus Marks)**
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  The student correctly added all the required nodes to the graph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** The student correctly added the edges between the nodes, establishing the desired workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [9/4]:** The graph compilation is partially correct with a functioning structure. However, the execution flow is broken because of missing functionalities.  (Bonus marks awarded for demonstrating a functioning graph structure despite the missing modules).

---

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrated a good understanding of LangGraph's node and edge structure and successfully created a basic workflow graph. However, several crucial modules were missing, significantly impacting the functionality of the application.  Focus on implementing the missing evaluation and marks processing modules, improving the robustness of class extraction, and ensuring proper state management throughout the graph.  Consider more sophisticated parsing techniques and error handling.
