## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks specificity in handling diverse Java code structures.  It could benefit from examples of expected output formats to guide the LLM more effectively.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
The student's code does not implement parsing of the LLM's output to extract individual classes.  The `parse_extracted_classes` function from the model solution was not utilized.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving mechanism is implemented for extracted classes. The necessary state variable `extracted_classes` remains empty.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No attempt was made to design a prompt for rubric extraction.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing or extraction of rubric details is implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for extracted rubric information is implemented.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt design for initial evaluation is present in the student's submission.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No parsing or extraction of evaluation scores and comments is performed.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving mechanism for initial evaluations is implemented.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt is provided for reviewing evaluations.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No code is present to extract reviewed evaluations.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for reviewed evaluations is present.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt is designed for marks extraction.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction of marks from the LLM response is implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving of extracted marks is implemented.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No prompt is designed for using the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No extraction of the final sum from the LLM response.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No state saving for final marks.

#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All nodes were correctly added to the graph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The edges connecting nodes in the workflow were correctly implemented.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compilation was largely successful, although some minor issues were present.

**Feedback:**  
The student's submission demonstrates a good understanding of LangGraph's structure and the overall workflow design. However, the implementation of prompt design, parsing of LLM responses, and state management are significantly lacking. Focusing on these critical aspects, referencing the provided model solution, and thoroughly testing each module before integration will greatly enhance the functionality of the application.  The graph construction itself was nearly flawless.
