## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 14/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [1/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
The prompt design is completely inadequate. The student attempts to use a single prompt for both student and model solutions, but the prompt lacks the necessary structure and clarity to effectively guide the LLM in extracting individual classes.  It does not specify the desired output format, leading to a parsing failure.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
Due to the poor prompt design, the LLM's output is not in the expected format. The student's attempt to parse the output using `json.loads()` fails with a `JSONDecodeError`.  They receive only a partial score because they attempted to parse and handle potential errors, even if unsuccessfully.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
The extracted class information is not properly saved to the state variable `state['student_classes']` because of the failure in parsing.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a rubric extraction method.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a rubric extraction method.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a rubric extraction method.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include an initial evaluation method.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include an initial evaluation method.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include an initial evaluation method.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a review evaluation method.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a review evaluation method.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a review evaluation method.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a marks extraction method.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a marks extraction method.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a marks extraction method.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a total marks calculation method which utilizes the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a total marks calculation method which utilizes the `sum_marks` tool.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
No marks awarded. The student's code doesn't include a total marks calculation method which utilizes the `sum_marks` tool.


#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All modules are correctly added as nodes.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
All edges between the modules are correctly added.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:**  
The graph compiles, but there are runtime errors due to missing or incorrect implementations in the nodes.  Partial credit given for the structure of the graph itself.

---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph's structure by correctly setting up the nodes and edges. However, the LLM prompt design and output parsing are significantly flawed, leading to the failure of most modules. Focus on improving prompt engineering and error handling, ensuring clear instructions and expected output formats for the LLM.  Implement the missing modules (Rubric Extraction, Initial Evaluation, Review Evaluation, Marks Extraction, Total Marks Calculation) to complete the workflow.
