## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes but lacks specificity.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on the desired output format (e.g., JSON, a dictionary).  More precise instructions are needed to improve accuracy.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The code attempts to parse the LLM output, but its reliance on newline separation is fragile and error-prone. A more robust parsing mechanism, potentially using regular expressions, is required.  The extraction is incomplete.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The extracted class information is not saved to state variables, preventing proper workflow continuation.  This is a major flaw.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [2/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** The prompt attempts to extract rubric details but is too generic.  Instructions on the expected output format are missing.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The code parses the LLM output, but it doesn't handle potential errors or variations in the LLM's response format effectively.  This leads to inaccurate extraction.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  No state saving is implemented for rubric details.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [2/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** The prompt design is a reasonable attempt to prompt for initial evaluation, but it lacks detailed instructions about the desired response structure.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  Extraction of the evaluation is attempted, however it is dependent on the LLM following a specific format which is not enforced.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving for initial evaluations.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [2/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  The prompt attempts to ask for a review of the initial evaluation, but lacks the necessary detail and guidance for the LLM on how to respond.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The extraction of the reviewed evaluation is done, but lacks error handling and structured parsing.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  No state saving for reviewed evaluations.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [2/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  The prompt tries to extract marks but lacks specification.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The code attempts to extract marks but assumes a specific, simple format that is not guaranteed from the LLM.  Error handling is missing.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving implemented.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [2/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** A `sum_marks` function is defined, but the design is very simple and lacks robustness.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  Extraction of the sum is simple.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:** No state saving for final marks.


#### 7. Graph Construction [5/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [2/5]:** Some nodes are added correctly, but not all.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [2/5]:** Some edges are added correctly, but not all, due to lack of state saving.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [1/4]:**  The graph compilation is attempted, but fails.

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrated some understanding of the LangGraph framework and LLM prompting. However, the submission lacks robust error handling and sophisticated parsing mechanisms for LLM outputs.  A significant weakness is the complete absence of state saving between modules, making the workflow incomplete.  Focus on improving data structures for storing intermediate results and implementing more robust parsing strategies.  Use of a more appropriate LLM for code-related tasks should also be considered.
