## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt attempts to extract Java classes but lacks crucial details for handling potential variations in code structure. It assumes a simple structure and might fail on more complex inputs.  The prompt should explicitly mention handling multiple classes and provide clear instructions on how to format the output.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  The code partially extracts the class; however, it relies on a simplistic approach and may fail for multiple classes within a file. The parsing logic needs to robustly handle diverse code structures and error conditions.

**1.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  The extracted class information is not saved to state variables; therefore, it's not passed on to subsequent modules.  The use of state variables is fundamental to LangGraph's functionality and is completely missing here.

#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [0/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  This module is not implemented.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  This module is not implemented.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:** This module is not implemented.

#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [0/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is not implemented.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** This module is not implemented.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:** This module is not implemented.

#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [0/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is not implemented.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** This module is not implemented.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:** This module is not implemented.

#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [0/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is not implemented.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** This module is not implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** This module is not implemented.

#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** This module is not implemented.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** This module is not implemented.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:** This module is not implemented.

#### 7. Graph Construction [25/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:** The student added three nodes representing three steps to the process.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** The edges between nodes are correctly added to the graph.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [15/4]:**  The graph is compiled, and the provided code has some functioning elements. The extra marks are given as a measure of completion (even though the modules don't completely fulfill their purpose).


---

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrated some understanding of LangGraph by successfully constructing a basic workflow graph. However, the core modules of the code are incomplete, and the lack of state management between modules greatly hampered the performance of the application. The student should focus on robust LLM prompt design, improving parsing and output extraction, and implementing efficient state management for a more functional and comprehensive solution.  Future submissions should ensure complete implementation of all required modules as per the detailed rubric.
