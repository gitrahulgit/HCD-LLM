## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** The prompt design attempts to extract classes but lacks precision. It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on the desired output format (e.g., JSON, a list of class names and code blocks).  This makes parsing the output more challenging.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The parsing logic attempts to extract classes, but it is highly dependent on the LLM's output format, which is not consistently structured.  The code doesn't handle various potential output formats robustly.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:** The extracted class information is saved into the state using `state['student_classes'] = student_classes`, which is correct.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [4/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt is reasonably designed to extract relevant rubric details given a class name. However, it could benefit from more specific instructions on the desired format of the extracted information.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** The parsing successfully extracts the LLM's output.

**2.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  The extracted rubric details are not saved correctly. The `class_rubrics` dictionary is created but not consistently added to the state.


#### 3. Initial Evaluation Method [4/6]
**3.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt attempts to include relevant information, but lacks structure and clarity. A more organized prompt would improve the LLM's response quality.

**3.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:** Parsing the LLM's evaluation is done correctly.

**3.3. State Saving [0/1]:** Initial evaluations are not saved properly in the state variable.


#### 4. Review Evaluation Method [4/6]
**4.1. Prompt Design [2/3]:** The prompt for review is functional but could be more precise in its instructions.  It doesn't explicitly state the expected format of the revised evaluation.

**4.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [2/2]:**  The parsing of the reviewed evaluation is correctly implemented.

**4.3. State Saving [0/1]:** The reviewed evaluations are not saved in the state variable.


#### 5. Marks Extraction Method [2/6]
**5.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:** The prompt for mark extraction is basic. It could benefit from specifying the desired format (comma-separated) and handling cases with missing or invalid marks.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:** The parsing correctly extracts the string, but does not handle cases where the response does not contain numbers.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:** Marks are not saved to the state variable.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:** The `sum_marks` function is implemented separately, but it's not integrated into the LangGraph workflow.  The prompt for calculating total marks is missing.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:** Total marks are not extracted.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:** Total marks are not saved.


#### 7. Graph Construction [13/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:** All nodes are added correctly.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:** All edges are added correctly.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [3/4]:** The graph compilation is mostly correct.  There's no explicit compilation step visible in the code.


---

**Feedback:**  The student demonstrates a good understanding of the overall LangGraph structure and node creation.  However, there are significant weaknesses in prompt engineering, output parsing, and especially state management. The code heavily relies on successful LLM responses with specific formats, which is not robust. Focusing on improving prompt design, error handling, and state management would greatly enhance the solution's functionality and robustness.  The `sum_marks` function is well-implemented, but needs to be integrated into the workflow.
