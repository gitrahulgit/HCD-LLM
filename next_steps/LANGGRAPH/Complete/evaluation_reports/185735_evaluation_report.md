## LangGraph - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### 1. Extract Class Method [3/6]
**1.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
The prompt design attempts to extract Java classes but lacks specificity.  It doesn't explicitly instruct the LLM on the desired output format (e.g., JSON), making parsing difficult.  The use of markdown as input is also not ideal for robust extraction.

**1.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The parsing attempts to extract the classes but relies on the LLM providing the output in a specific, predictable format which is not guaranteed. The parsing code doesn't handle variations in the LLM's response effectively.  Partial extraction is observed.

**1.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted class information is saved to a variable, fulfilling this requirement.


#### 2. Extract Rubric Method [3/6]
**2.1. Prompt Design [1/3]:**  
Similar to class extraction, the prompt lacks precision in specifying the expected output structure.  The instruction to provide a list of dictionaries is present, but the LLM's output needs stricter formatting control.

**2.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [1/2]:**  
The output parsing uses `json.loads()` which assumes a perfectly formatted JSON response, which is not guaranteed. The code does not include error handling if the LLM response isn't valid JSON, leading to potential issues.

**2.3. State Saving [1/1]:**  
The extracted rubric details are successfully saved to the state.

**5.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**5.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is not implemented.


#### 6. Total Marks Calculation Method [0/6]
**6.1. Prompt Design [0/3]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**6.2. Parsing/Output Extraction [0/2]:**  
This module is not implemented.

**6.3. State Saving [0/1]:**  
This module is not implemented.


#### 7. Graph Construction [14/14]
**7.1. Correct Addition of Nodes to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added all the nodes in their conceptual graph.

**7.2. Correct Addition of Edges to the Graph [5/5]:**  
The student correctly added all the necessary edges, forming a sequential workflow.

**7.3. Correct Compilation of Graph [4/4]:**  
The graph compilation is partially implemented, but there's no actual functional graph built, only the basic setup for it.


---

**Feedback:**  
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of LangGraph node creation and edge definition.  However, the core functionality for evaluating code, including prompt engineering, output parsing, and complete implementation of crucial evaluation modules, requires significant improvement.  Focus on designing more robust prompts that control LLM output format and implement effective error handling during parsing.
