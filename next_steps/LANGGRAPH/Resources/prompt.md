#### Your evaluation must include:

1. **Code Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the student's submission against the **problem_statement**, **model_solution**, and **rubric**.
   - Be flexible with alternative approaches if they meet the requirements, and reward partial implementations that show understanding.

2. **Marks Allocation**  
   - Allocate marks clearly for each module and sub-module in the format `[X/Y]`.

4. **Grading Criteria**  
   - **Flexibility**: Accept different approaches if they solve the problem correctly.
   - **Reward Partial Implementation**: Give credit for partially correct solutions that indicate understanding.
   - **Avoid Penalizing Style Deviations**: Do not penalize minor deviations in coding style or logic if the functionality is correct.
   - **Fairness and Clarity**: Ensure fairness, transparency, and clarity in all evaluations.
