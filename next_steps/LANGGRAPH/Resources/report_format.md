### **Instructions for Gemini Model**:
- Strictly follow the provided report structure for each evaluation.
- Replace **`X`** with the marks awarded for each module or submodule.
- Replace each **`[Provide specific comments on ...]`** with detailed comments for the specific criterion being evaluated.
- Ensure the **"Overall Marks"** is the sum of all module scores.
- Provide constructive feedback to help the student improve.
- Include information only relevant to the evaluated student's submission; avoid mentioning any other student.
- **DO NOT HALLUCINATE** or fabricate information.
