### JAVA Lab Examination  

---

**PURPOSE:**  
To conduct a comprehensive JAVA lab examination for undergraduate students, testing their knowledge and application of core Java programming concepts in a real-world scenario.

---

### **TASKS**

#### **1. Generate a Detailed Problem Statement**
1. Create a **real-world scenario-based problem** that requires the application of Core Java concepts. The problem must involve:
   - **Classes and Objects**
   - **Inheritance**
   - **Polymorphism**
   - **Exception Handling**
   - **File I/O**
2. The problem should:
   - Be complex enough to test students' understanding and problem-solving skills.
   - Avoid overwhelming students with excessive complexity.
   - Clearly specify **input and output requirements**, along with **assumptions and constraints**.
3. **Break down the problem** into **modules and sub-modules** for clarity and to simplify evaluation.  
   - Each module should address a specific aspect of the problem, with clearly defined objectives.

#### **2. Generate a Model Solution**
1. Provide a **complete and correct implementation** of the problem in Java, adhering to:
   - Java programming **best practices**.
   - Proper **naming conventions** and **code structure**.
   - Adequate **documentation and comments** to explain the implementation.
2. The solution must demonstrate effective use of:
   - **OOP principles** (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism).
   - **Robust error handling** with custom exceptions.
   - **File input/output operations** to manage data.
3. Include **unit tests** to verify the correctness of each module and sub-module, ensuring functionality and accuracy.

#### **3. Develop a Detailed Marking Scheme (Rubric)**  
1. Define the **total marks** as **50**.  
2. Create a **clear, concise, and unambiguous marking scheme** that:  
   - Covers all aspects of the **problem statement**.  
   - Is flexible enough to accommodate **different solution approaches**, ensuring fair and reasonable evaluation of alternative methods.
3. Award marks **suitably and sensibly** if a student's solution differs from the expected model solution, as long as it adheres to the problem requirements. Avoid awarding more or fewer marks arbitrarily for valid alternative approaches.
4. Include marks for correctness, adherence to OOP principles, exception handling, file I/O implementation, code efficiency, and documentation.    
5. Exclude any marks for test cases or automated testing to focus on conceptual understanding and implementation skills.

#### **4. Evaluate and Grade Student Submissions**
1. Evaluate students' Java code submissions based on the **problem statement**, **model solution**, and **marking scheme**.
2. For each student:
   - Provide a **detailed report** that includes:
     - Marks awarded or deducted for each module/sub-module.
     - Write marks against each module/sub-module. Eg: [x/y] marks.
     - **Explanations for deductions** to ensure transparency.
   - Offer **constructive feedback** (approximately 50 words) to help the student improve.
   - Include a **final overall grade** based on the evaluation.

#### **5. Generate 15 Different Student Solutions**
Create **13 diverse student solutions** to the problem statement, representing varying levels of correctness, complexity, and creativity:  

1. **Solution 1:** Closely resembles the **model solution** but is not identical.  
2. **Solution 2:** Slightly different from the **model solution**, demonstrating alternative approaches.  
3. **Solution 3:** Contains **syntax errors** (e.g., missing semicolons, unmatched brackets).  
4. **Solution 4:** A nearly correct implementation, but with **logic errors** in the code.  
5. **Solution 5:** Contains **runtime errors** due to improper error handling or invalid operations.  
6. **Solution 6:** Demonstrates **memory management errors** (e.g., memory leaks or inefficient resource handling).  
7. **Solution 7:** A completely **different approach** compared to the model solution.  
8. **Solution 8:** A solution which is **partially correct**, but with incomplete implementation of the problem.  
9. **Solution 9:** **Incorrect implementation**, despite appearing logically correct.  
10. **Solution 10:** A mix of correct and incorrect portions, partially similar to the **model solution**.  
11. **Solution 11:** A **completely wrong implementation**, showing a lack of understanding of the problem.  
12. **Solution 12:** A correct implementation, but with **incorrect output formatting** as specified in the problem statement.  
13. **Solution 13:** A **different but correct and efficient solution**, showcasing creativity and efficiency.
14. **Solution 14:** An implementation of the problem statement, where **only some modules are implemented correctly**, while others are **not implemented** at all.  
15. **Solution 15:** A implementation of the problem statement,  where **some modules are implemented correctly**, while others are **incorrectly implemented**.
    
#### **6. Ensure Diversity in Complexity and Difficulty**
1. Each solution should vary in complexity, ensuring a range of difficulty levels to challenge students with varying skill sets.  
2. Solutions should highlight different coding styles and thought processes.
