### List of Student Solutions with Titles and Notes

---
#### Strictly adhere to the following:

**Student Solution 1:** Closely Resembles the Model Solution  
**Note:** This solution is almost identical to the model solution, with minor variations in structure and comments. It demonstrates a complete and correct implementation of all functionalities.

---

**Student Solution 2:** Alternative Correct Approach  
**Note:** Uses a slightly different method for managing data, such as using `List` instead of `Map`. Demonstrates correctness and creativity while meeting the problem requirements.

---

**Student Solution 3:** Contains Syntax Errors  
**Note:** This solution has almost identical structure to the model solution but has missing semicolons, unmatched brackets, and other syntactical issues. It shows an attempt to implement the problem but fails to compile.

---

**Student Solution 4:** Nearly Correct but with Logic Errors  
**Note:** The solution implements most functionalities but includes logic flaws, such as not checking book availability before borrowing or exceeding borrowing limits.

---

**Student Solution 5:** Contains Runtime Errors  
**Note:** While appearing correct, the solution fails due to improper error handling, such as `NullPointerException` when accessing uninitialized objects.

---

**Student Solution 6:** Memory Management Issues  
**Note:** Has more than half of the code implemented correctly. But demonstrates inefficient resource handling, such as not closing file streams, leading to potential memory leaks.

---

**Student Solution 7:** Completely Different Approach  
**Note:** Implements the problem requirements using interfaces, linked lists, and alternative data structures. While correct, it deviates significantly from the model solution.

---

**Student Solution 8:** Partially Correct and Incomplete  
**Note:** Focuses on implementing only book management while leaving borrower management and transaction handling unimplemented.

---

**Student Solution 9:** Incorrect Implementation Despite Logical Appearance  
**Note:** Appears logically correct but incorrectly removes books from the system after borrowing instead of marking them as unavailable.

---

**Student Solution 10:** Mixed Correct and Incorrect Portions  
**Note:** Implements some modules correctly, such as book availability checks, but fails in others, such as updating borrower records.

---

**Student Solution 11:** Completely Wrong Implementation  
**Note:** Shows a lack of understanding of the problem, with no attempt to implement the required functionalities beyond a simple "Hello World"-style placeholder.

---

**Student Solution 12:** Correct Implementation with Incorrect Output Formatting  
**Note:** Meets all functional requirements but does not adhere to the specified output format, affecting usability and clarity.

---

**Student Solution 13:** Different, Correct, and Efficient Solution  
**Note:** Uses a creative and efficient approach, such as sets for faster lookups and JSON for file I/O, showcasing advanced problem-solving skills.

---

**Student Solution 14:** Some Modules Correctly Implemented, Others Missing  
**Note:** Implements book management correctly but entirely skips borrower management and transaction handling.

---

**Student Solution 15:** Some Modules Correctly Implemented, Others Incorrectly Implemented  
**Note:** Borrower registration is correctly implemented, but the book borrowing process fails to validate borrower existence or update book availability properly.
