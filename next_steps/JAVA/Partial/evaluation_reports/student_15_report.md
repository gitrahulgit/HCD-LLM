**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, successfully adding books with all required fields.  No issues with input validation or duplicate prevention were observed.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only books marked as available.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The student attempted to implement `updateBook`, however it only allows for updating the name, author and genre but not the availability status which was a requirement.


**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers, preventing duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method displays borrowed books, but does not indicate which books have been returned. This was a required part of the functionality.


**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (4/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly updates the book availability status, but lacks the crucial check for the borrower's limit of 5 books.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles return operations and updates borrower records.  Appropriate error handling for cases where the book is not borrowed by the borrower is present.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**

Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated through the `LibraryEntity` base class, extending functionality to `Book` and `Borrower`.

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
Polymorphism is not explicitly demonstrated. While methods are used in different contexts, there's no clear example of method overriding or overloading.

---

**Feedback:**
The project demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles, with the use of inheritance and a custom exception class standing out.  However, the implementation of the borrowing limit check, robust file handling, and addressing edge cases are key areas for improvement to ensure greater system stability and error resilience.  The serialization approach is also not the optimal for this application.  Consider further refining the use of interfaces for better design and extensibility.
