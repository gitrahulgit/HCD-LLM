## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 42/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student's code correctly implements the addition of books, storing them in a `HashMap` for efficient access. Input validation is not explicitly implemented but is not crucial for basic functionality.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):**  The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The `updateBook` method is implemented correctly; however, it lacks validation for ensuring that the provided `bookId` exists before attempting an update.  A `LibraryException` should be thrown if the book ID is not found.


**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method functions correctly, adding borrowers to a `HashMap`.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method successfully retrieves borrower information. However, it only shows the list of borrowed books; a more comprehensive history including borrowing and return dates would improve this section.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing, including updating book availability and borrower records.  Exception handling for non-existent book or borrower IDs is implemented correctly.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles returns and updates records; error handling for non-existent IDs is also correctly implemented.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student uses appropriate classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects effectively to represent library entities.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
* Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated via the `LibraryItem` abstract class.  Attributes common to `Book` and `Borrower` are appropriately included.

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
* Polymorphism is demonstrated by the use of the `toString()` method correctly in both the `Book` and `Borrower` classes.  However, further demonstration through method overloading or overriding could have been done.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
* Encapsulation is partially implemented using private fields and getters for necessary attributes. Setters should have been included for more complete encapsulation.


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
* `try-catch` blocks are used effectively in various methods for handling potential exceptions.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used appropriately for handling library-specific errors.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* The solution does not explicitly handle edge cases such as invalid input data types (e.g., non-numeric IDs, non-string fields).  More robust validation checks are necessary to handle such cases.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* Data saving is implemented using serialization.  Data is stored in separate files for books and borrowers.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):**
* Data loading is implemented correctly using deserialization. It checks if the files exist before attempting to load.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
*  Error handling for file I/O exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundException`, `IOException`) is missing.  The code should gracefully handle cases where files are missing or corrupted.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):**
* The use of `HashMaps` for storing books and borrowers is an efficient choice.  However, there's no further indication of other efficient algorithms.

#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):**
* The code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and is generally easy to read.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles. The implementation of the Library Management System is functional and covers most requirements.  However, improvements can be made by adding input validation, more comprehensive error handling (especially file I/O errors and edge cases), and enhancing the borrower history functionality to include dates.  Improving data encapsulation with the inclusion of setters is also important.

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
