* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):**  The student did not implement a method to display only available books.  The provided code displays all books regardless of their availability status.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (3/3):** Updating book details was not a requirement and was not implemented.  No marks deducted for its absence.


**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
