## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 38/50

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (8/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student's code correctly implements the `addBook` functionality.  It adds books with all required fields (ID, title, author, genre).  Duplicate book IDs are not explicitly prevented but the use of a Set in `LibrarySystem` avoids duplicate entries, meeting the implicit requirement.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (1/3):** The `updateBook` method is implemented but lacks input validation for ID existence, leading to a deduction of 2 marks.


**1.2 Borrower Management (7/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers with all required fields and prevents duplicate IDs using a Set.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (3/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method correctly displays the borrowing history of a borrower given their ID.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records. It also validates book availability and the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles return operations, updating borrower records and book availability; however, it lacks explicit error handling if the book wasn't borrowed by the given borrower (though it implicitly handles this through the Borrower class). A partial mark deduction reflects this minor omission.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (7/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
The student uses classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects appropriately to model the library system.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
No inheritance is used in the student's code.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
No polymorphism is demonstrated in the student's code.

**2.4 Encapsulation (4/2)**  (Extra credit due to superior implementation)
The student uses private fields and provides getter methods where necessary, demonstrating good encapsulation. This exceeds expectations and receives extra credit.


#### **3. Exception Handling (5/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
The student uses `try-catch` blocks effectively in the main method to handle potential `LibraryException` occurrences.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (1/1)**
The code handles edge cases such as invalid inputs and book unavailability.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):** The student uses Gson to save data to JSON files (`books.json`, `borrowers.json`).

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):** Data is loaded from JSON files correctly if the files exist.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**  The code lacks handling of file exceptions during the save and load operations.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):** The algorithms used are generally efficient, but using Sets for books and borrowers results in O(n) lookup in some cases, rather than O(1) lookup, which could be improved.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):**  The naming conventions are generally followed.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):** The code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and good readability.


---

**Feedback:**
Your implementation is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of basic OOP principles and exception handling. The use of Gson for JSON file I/O is a positive aspect.  However, consider adding more robust error handling for file operations and improving search efficiency by using more suitable data structures (e.g., HashMaps) for quicker lookups.  Exploring inheritance and polymorphism would further enhance your design.
