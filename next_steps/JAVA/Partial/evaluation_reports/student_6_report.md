* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers, preventing duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method returns the `Borrower` object containing the list of borrowed books; however, the format of the output is not as specified in the problem statement.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (8/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records, and validating the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles return operations and updates records.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (7/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
The student effectively models the system using `Book` and `Borrower` classes and utilizes these classes in the `LibrarySystem`.

**2.2 Inheritance (2/3)**
The student uses inheritance correctly with `Book` and `Borrower` extending `LibraryEntity`.  However, the `LibraryEntity` class could be further improved to handle some common functionalities of both.

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
No clear demonstration of polymorphism is present in the code.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
While the student uses private fields, the access modifiers are inconsistent and could be improved for better encapsulation. Getters and setters are not used for all necessary fields.

#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**

---

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles. The implementation of the core functionalities is largely correct, with minor flaws in update book details and borrower history display. The use of a custom exception class is well done and improves robustness. Improving input validation and error handling, as well as enhancing file I/O robustness, would significantly improve the overall quality of the project.   Consider focusing on consistent naming conventions and implementing more efficient data structures for better performance and scalability.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student uses appropriate classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects to represent entities and manage their state.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
* Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated with the `LibraryEntity` abstract base class, extending functionality to both `Book` and `Borrower`.

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
*  Polymorphism is partially demonstrated via method overriding in the `toString()` method, but no method overloading is present.

#### **4. File I/O Implementation (3/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* Data saving is implemented, but using ObjectOutputStream may cause issues with different Java versions and makes handling errors difficult.

**4.2 Load Data (1/2):**
* Data loading is implemented, but using ObjectInputStream suffers from the same issues as the save method.

---

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles. The implementation of the core functionalities is largely correct, and exception handling is well-done. However, the file I/O implementation lacks robustness and error handling.  Improving code style, adding complete getter methods, and implementing input validation will enhance the quality and maintainability of the code.  Consider using more standard serialization techniques for file I/O for better compatibility and error handling.
