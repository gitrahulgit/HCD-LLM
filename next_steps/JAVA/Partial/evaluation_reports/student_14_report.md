**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (15/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (6/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, allowing the addition of new books with all required fields.  No input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (2/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method correctly retrieves and displays available books. However, no test was included to demonstrate its functionality.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):** The `updateBook` method is implemented, but it only updates the title, author, and genre.  The availability status is not updated, which is a key requirement.  Additionally, there's no handling of invalid `bookId` inputs.

**1.2 Borrower Management (0/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (0/4):**  Borrower management functionality is entirely missing.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):**  Borrower management functionality is entirely missing.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (0/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (0/5):** Transaction handling (borrowing and returning books) is completely absent.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (0/3):** Transaction handling (borrowing and returning books) is completely absent.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (3/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student appropriately used classes (`Book`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects to represent the library system components.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* Polymorphism was not demonstrated in the submitted code.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
* Encapsulation was partially implemented. While fields are declared within the classes, getters and setters are not consistently used across all fields.  The `isAvailable` field's setter is correctly implemented, but the other fields are directly accessed and modified.

#### **3. Exception Handling (2/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (1/2)**
* `try-catch` blocks are used to catch `IOException` and `ClassNotFoundException` during file handling, but no other exceptions are handled.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (1/2)**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used to throw exceptions in the `updateBook` method. However, it's used only in a single case.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**

* The file handling lacks robustness and does not check for any potential errors while reading or writing other than the file not existing.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (2/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (1/3)**
* The algorithms used are relatively straightforward and efficient for the implemented functionalities.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2)**
* The code mostly adheres to Java naming conventions, though some minor inconsistencies exist.

#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5)**
* The code is well-formatted and easy to read with consistent indentation.
