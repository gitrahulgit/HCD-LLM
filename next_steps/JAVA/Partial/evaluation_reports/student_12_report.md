**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student's code correctly implements the functionality to add books, including all required fields.  No obvious flaws in input validation or duplicate prevention were detected.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only books marked as available.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The `updateBook` method allows for modification of book details.  However, it lacks robust input validation for the provided details (title, author, genre), which should be considered.

**1.2 Borrower Management (7/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The student successfully implements borrower registration, preventing duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (3/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method correctly displays the borrowing history of a specified borrower based on the Borrower ID.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (6/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (4/5):** The `borrowBook` method handles borrowing operations correctly. The method checks for book availability and throws an exception if the book is not available.  However, the code does not explicitly check against the borrowing limit of 5 books per borrower.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method functions as expected, updating book availability and borrower records.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student appropriately models the system using classes (Book, Borrower, LibrarySystem) and objects.  Data is encapsulated within these classes.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
* Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated with `Book` and `Borrower` inheriting from `LibraryEntity`.

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
*  Polymorphism is not explicitly demonstrated (e.g., through overridden methods or overloading).

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
* While the student uses private fields, the getter and setter methods for the Book class are limited.


#### **3. Exception Handling (5/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
* `try-catch` blocks are used effectively to handle potential `LibraryException` instances.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and utilized appropriately.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (1/1)**
*  The code demonstrates handling of edge cases, such as invalid or missing book IDs and borrower IDs.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2)**
* The student implements saving of data to files (`books.dat`, `borrowers.dat`).

**4.2 Load Data (2/2)**
* The loading of data from files is correctly implemented with checks for file existence.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1)**
*  The use of `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`  could result in issues with future updates.   A more robust approach (e.g., using a structured text format like JSON or CSV) would be preferred.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3)**
* Algorithms used are efficient for the current scope of the project, but could be improved with more advanced data structures if the number of books or borrowers significantly increases.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2)**
*  Minor inconsistencies in naming conventions were observed.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5)**
* The code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and clear variable naming (mostly).


---

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles.  The implementation of the Library Management System is largely functional, with effective exception handling and file I/O.  However, the code could benefit from more comprehensive input validation and further refinements to improve code maintainability, particularly through the use of more standardized serialization and potentially more efficient data structures for very large datasets.  Focus on consistent naming conventions and exploring better approaches to data persistence.

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, adding books to the `books` map.  Input validation for duplicate book IDs is not explicitly implemented, but the HashMap structure inherently prevents duplicates.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):**  The `updateBook` method allows updating book details, but lacks input validation for the existence of the Book ID, resulting in a potential runtime exception if an invalid ID is provided.

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method functions correctly, adding borrowers to the `borrowers` map.  Duplicate ID prevention is implicitly handled by the HashMap.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method retrieves borrower history but throws a LibraryException only when the borrowerId is invalid and does not handle the case when no books are borrowed by the given borrower.


**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (4/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing, updating availability and borrower records.  However, it lacks detailed error handling for invalid book IDs.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles book returns and updates records.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
The student demonstrates some polymorphism through method overriding (`toString()` in `Book`), but does not demonstrate method overloading.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
The student uses private fields but does not always use getters and setters consistently (e.g., directly modifying `name` in `updateBook`).

#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2):**  The student uses try-catch blocks effectively in the `main` method to handle exceptions.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2):** The student defined and used a custom `LibraryException` class appropriately.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1):** The student's handling of edge cases (like invalid inputs and missing files) is inadequate;  more comprehensive error checking and handling is needed.

#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):** The `saveData` method correctly saves data using `ObjectOutputStream`.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):** The `loadData` method correctly loads data using `ObjectInputStream`, handling the case of missing files.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):** The code lacks error handling within the `saveData` and `loadData` methods, which could lead to unexpected behavior if file operations fail.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):** Algorithms are generally efficient, though some improvements could be made (e.g., using more efficient data structures where applicable).

**Feedback:**
The submission demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and object-oriented programming.  The implementation of the Library Management System is largely functional, meeting most of the requirements.  However, improving exception handling, particularly for edge cases and file I/O errors, and ensuring consistent use of getters and setters would significantly enhance robustness and maintainability.  Consider adding more robust input validation to prevent runtime errors.
