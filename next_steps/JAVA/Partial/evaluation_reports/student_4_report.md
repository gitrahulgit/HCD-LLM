**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (10/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (4/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (2/4):** The student implemented a `Book` class and added a method to add books, but input validation and duplicate prevention are missing.  The `addBook` method is not implemented in the `LibrarySystem` class, making it inaccessible.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):** This functionality is not implemented.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):** This functionality is not implemented.

**1.2 Borrower Management (3/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (2/4):** The student implemented a `Borrower` class and added a method to register borrowers, however, duplicate ID prevention is missing.  The method to register borrowers is not present in `LibrarySystem`.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (1/3):**  A method to get borrowed books is implemented in the `Borrower` class, but it is not used within a larger system to display a user's borrowing history.  Partial credit is awarded for this implementation.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (3/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (2/5):** The `borrowBook` method in `LibrarySystem` partially implements borrowing functionality. It checks for null borrowers and books.  However, it lacks crucial components such as handling the borrowing limit and updating the book's availability status within the `books` map.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (1/3):** The `returnBook` method in the `Borrower` class handles the return operation and exception handling, but it's not fully integrated into the main system to update book availability. Partial credit given for the exception handling.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (0/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (0/3)**
* The student created `Book` and `Borrower` classes but did not effectively utilize object-oriented principles in the design and implementation. A `Library` class is missing.

**Feedback:**
The submission demonstrates a basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts with the creation of `Book` and `Borrower` classes.  However, the implementation is incomplete, lacking key features like file I/O and crucial parts of book management, borrower management, and transaction handling.  Focus on completing the core functionalities, implementing file I/O for data persistence, and improving code structure and adherence to OOP principles.  Consider utilizing a `Library` class to manage books and borrowers.
