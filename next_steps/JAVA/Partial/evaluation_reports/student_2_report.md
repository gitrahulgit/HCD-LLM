**Feedback:**
Your code demonstrates a good understanding of basic object-oriented programming concepts and exception handling.  The core functionalities are partially implemented.  However, you need to incorporate file I/O for data persistence and improve error handling to make the system more robust.  Consider using more efficient data structures and algorithms, and explore inheritance and polymorphism for better code organization and extensibility.
