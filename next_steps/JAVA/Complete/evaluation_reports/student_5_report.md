## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 15/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (5/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (2/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (1/4):** The student implemented a basic `addBook` method, but it lacks input validation and duplicate prevention.  Only the `id` and `title` are stored.  No availability tracking.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):** This functionality is entirely missing.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):**  This functionality is entirely missing.

**1.2 Borrower Management (0/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (0/4):**  Borrower management is entirely missing.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):** This functionality is entirely missing.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (3/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (0/5):** Borrowing functionality is entirely missing.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (0/3):** Returning functionality is entirely missing.  The student only implemented a display function.  No data persistence.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (0/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (0/3)**
* The student created a `Book` class, but it is very rudimentary and lacks essential attributes like author, genre, and availability.  The `LibrarySystem` class is also insufficiently developed.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
* No inheritance is used in the student's code.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* No polymorphism is demonstrated.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
*  The `Book` class fields are not private.  Appropriate getters and setters are absent.


#### **3. Exception Handling (0/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (0/2)**
* No `try-catch` blocks are used.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (0/2)**
* No custom exception class is created or used.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* No edge case handling is implemented.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (0/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (0/2)**
* No file I/O is implemented for saving data.

**4.2 Load Data (0/2)**
* No file I/O is implemented for loading data.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1)**
* No file handling robustness is demonstrated.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (0/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (0/3)**
* No efficient algorithms were used. The code is very basic and lacks sophistication.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (0/2)**
* While the code follows some naming conventions, this only applies to the limited functionality, and the naming could be improved.

#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5)**
* The code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and spacing, making it relatively readable despite the limited functionality.

**Feedback:**
The submission demonstrates a basic understanding of creating classes in Java. However, the core functionalities of the library management system are largely missing.  Focus on implementing the remaining requirements outlined in the problem statement, particularly book availability, borrower management, and transaction handling.  Pay close attention to using OOP principles and exception handling for robust error management.  Consider using more suitable data structures (like Maps) for efficiency.
