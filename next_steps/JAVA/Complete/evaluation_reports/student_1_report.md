## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 42/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the functionality to add books, including all required fields (Book ID, title, author, genre).  Input validation is not explicitly implemented, but the solution does not fail on invalid input.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only books marked as available.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The student implemented `updateBook`  but did not handle cases where the book ID does not exist (error handling is missing).


**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The student correctly implemented borrower registration, preventing duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method retrieves and displays a borrower's history. However, it doesn't explicitly return the data (instead it prints directly).


**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records.  The borrowing limit is correctly enforced.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method handles return operations and updates records.  The implementation correctly verifies if the borrower had borrowed the book.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
The student uses appropriate classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`) to represent entities and manage their state.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated with the `LibraryItem` base class and derived classes (`Book`, `Borrower`).

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
Polymorphism is partially implemented.  Method overriding is shown in toString(), but method overloading is missing.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
Encapsulation is partially implemented.  Private fields are used, but getters/setters are missing for some fields (e.g., `author`, `genre`, `contactInfo`).


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
Appropriate `try-catch` blocks are implemented to handle runtime exceptions, but not all exceptions are handled.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
A custom `LibraryException` class is created and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
The handling of edge cases, such as invalid inputs, is missing in several methods.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**  Data saving functionality is implemented using `ObjectOutputStream`.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):** Data loading is implemented and handles the case where files do not exist.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**  The solution lacks error handling for potential file I/O exceptions during save/load operations.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (3/3):** The algorithms used are efficient and logically sound.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (0/2):** The student did not consistently follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `isAvailable` instead of `available`).


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):** The code is well-formatted and easy to read, with consistent indentation.

---

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrated a good understanding of OOP principles and implemented core functionalities effectively.  The use of a custom exception class is a strength.  However, improvements are needed in error handling, input validation, and consistent adherence to Java naming conventions.  Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and improving the data persistence to prevent possible data loss.
