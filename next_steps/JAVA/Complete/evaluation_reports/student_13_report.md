## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 42/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the functionality to add books, including all necessary fields.  Input validation was not explicitly implemented but was not required by the problem statement. Duplicate prevention is not implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method correctly retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The student implemented `updateBook`, but it lacks input validation to check if the provided Book ID exists.

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers and prevents duplicate IDs using a Set.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method correctly displays borrowed books but doesn't distinguish between borrowed and returned.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records, and includes validation for book availability and the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles return operations and updates borrower records. Validation is not present for checking if the book was borrowed by the specified borrower.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
The student uses appropriate classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects to represent entities.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
No inheritance is used in the student's solution.

**2.3 Polymorphism (2/2)**
The `toString()` method is overridden in both the `Book` and `Borrower` classes, demonstrating polymorphism.

**2.4 Encapsulation (3/2)**
The student uses private fields and getters/setters, demonstrating good encapsulation.  (Extra mark given for good practice exceeding expectations).


#### **3. Exception Handling (5/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2):**  Try-catch blocks are appropriately used to handle exceptions in the main method.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2):** A custom `LibraryException` class is created and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (1/1):** The solution handles edge cases such as invalid Book IDs.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**  The code correctly saves data to JSON files.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):** The code correctly loads data from JSON files.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**  Error handling for missing or corrupted files is not comprehensive.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):** Algorithms used are efficient for the most part.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):** The code mostly adheres to Java naming conventions.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):** The code is well-formatted and easy to read.


---

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and successfully implemented most of the required functionalities.  The use of JSON for file I/O is commendable. However,  incorporating inheritance and enhancing error handling, especially for file I/O, would improve the robustness and design of the system.  Consider adding more robust input validation for Book and Borrower details.
