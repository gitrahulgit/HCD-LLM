## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 42/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, adding books with all required fields.  No duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The `updateBook` method allows modification of book details using a valid Book ID; however, input validation is missing, leading to a deduction.

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers, preventing duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):**  The `viewBorrowerHistory` method displays the borrowed books; however, it does not display the return status (borrowed/returned dates).

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records.  It correctly validates the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method handles return operations and updates borrower records; however, error handling for a non-existent borrower is lacking.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student appropriately modeled the system using classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`). Objects are used to represent entities and manage their state.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
* Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated using a base class (`LibraryEntity`) for common attributes and derived classes (`Book`, `Borrower`).

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
* Polymorphism is demonstrated through method overriding (`toString()`).  Method overloading was not utilized.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
* Private fields are used, but the getters and setters for all relevant fields are missing in both the Book and Borrower classes, which hinders proper encapsulation.


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
* Appropriate `try-catch` blocks are implemented to handle runtime exceptions.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom exception class (`LibraryException`) is created and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
*  Edge cases such as invalid inputs were not comprehensively addressed.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* Data is correctly saved to files using `ObjectOutputStream`.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):**
* Data is accurately loaded from files.  The code handles cases where files might not exist.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
*  The solution does not include error handling for potential file I/O issues beyond simply checking for the existence of files.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (3/3):**
* Efficient and logically sound algorithms are implemented.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (0/2):**
* The student's code does not consistently follow Java naming conventions (e.g., `isAvailable` instead of `available`).


#### **6. Code Formatting (4/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (4/5):**
* The code is generally readable and well-indented, but some improvements could be made in terms of spacing and line breaks for better clarity.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrated a good understanding of the core concepts, implementing most functionalities correctly.  The OOP principles were well-applied, but adding getters and setters and improving error handling will enhance code quality and robustness.  Improving adherence to naming conventions and addressing edge cases would also greatly improve the submission.
