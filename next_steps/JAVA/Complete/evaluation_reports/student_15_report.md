## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 38/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, allowing the addition of books with all required fields.  No duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The student implemented `updateBook`, allowing the modification of existing book details; however, input validation of the ID was not implemented.

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers and prevents duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method displays borrowed books, but there is no handling for returned books within the borrower history.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (4/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly updates availability and borrower records.  However, it lacks the constraint of the maximum 5 books limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles return operations and updates borrower records.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student appropriately models the system using classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`). Objects are used to represent entities and manage their state.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
* Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated with a base class `LibraryEntity` and derived classes `Book` and `Borrower`.

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
* Polymorphism is partially demonstrated through method overriding (`toString()`). Method overloading is absent.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
* Encapsulation is partially implemented.  While fields are declared private, getters are used inconsistently. Setters are missing for some fields.


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
* Appropriate `try-catch` blocks are implemented to handle runtime exceptions (e.g., file errors).

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom exception class (`LibraryException`) is created and used to handle specific library errors.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* Edge cases, such as invalid inputs, are not handled comprehensively.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* Correctly saves data to files using `ObjectOutputStream`.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):**
* Accurately loads data from files; however, error handling for missing files is rudimentary.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
* File handling lacks robustness; error handling is minimal.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):**
* Algorithms are generally efficient, but could be improved with more optimized data structures and input validation.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):**
* Mostly adheres to Java naming conventions, but some inconsistencies exist.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):**
* Code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and good readability.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles, implementing most of the required functionalities.  Strengths include the use of inheritance and exception handling.  Areas for improvement include more robust error handling, stricter input validation, implementing the five-book borrowing limit, completing the borrower history tracking for returned books, and improving encapsulation by consistently using getters and setters.  Consider adding more comprehensive input validation and implementing more efficient data structures.
