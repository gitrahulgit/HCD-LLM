## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (15/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (7/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, allowing the addition of books with all required fields.  No input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method correctly retrieves and displays only available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):** The `updateBook` method only updates the title, author, and genre, but not the availability status.  The functionality is partially implemented.

**1.2 Borrower Management (0/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (0/4):**  Borrower management is entirely missing from the student's submission.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):** Borrower management is entirely missing from the student's submission.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (8/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (0/5):**  Borrowing and returning functionality is not implemented.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (0/3):** Borrowing and returning functionality is not implemented.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (6/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
* The student uses classes `Book` and `LibrarySystem` appropriately to represent entities.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
* The student effectively uses inheritance with the `LibraryEntity` abstract class.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* Polymorphism is not demonstrated in the submitted code.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
* While fields are declared, encapsulation is not fully implemented, as there are no getters/setters for all fields.


#### **3. Exception Handling (2/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
* The student uses `try-catch` blocks to handle potential exceptions during file I/O operations.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (0/2)**
* The student defines a `LibraryException` class, but does not use it effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* No edge case handling is implemented.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (3/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* The student correctly saves book data to a file using `ObjectOutputStream`.

**4.2 Load Data (1/2):**
* The student loads data correctly but doesn't handle the case where the file doesn't exist.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1)**
* No error handling beyond the basic `try-catch` is implemented.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (2/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (1/3)**
* Algorithms are mostly straightforward but not optimally efficient.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2)**
* Mostly follows Java naming conventions, with some minor inconsistencies.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5)**
* Code is well-formatted and readable with consistent indentation.

**Feedback:**
The code demonstrates a basic understanding of object-oriented programming and file handling in Java.  Strengths include the use of inheritance and basic file I/O implementation.  However, significant improvements are needed in implementing core library functionalities such as borrower management and transaction handling, and robust error handling and exception management.  Adding input validation and more comprehensive testing will enhance the code's quality and reliability.
