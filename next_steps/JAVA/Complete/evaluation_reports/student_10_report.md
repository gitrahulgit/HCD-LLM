## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 38/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (8/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, adding books with ID and title.  No input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (1/3):**  The `updateBook` method only updates availability and doesn't allow for title changes as required.  ID validation is missing.

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers with ID and name.  Duplicate ID prevention is not implemented.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method correctly displays borrowed books; however, it lacks the return date information.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (8/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing, updating availability and borrower records.  It includes basic error handling for unavailable books.  Borrowing limit is not checked.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles returns and updates records.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (6/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (2/3)**
* The student used classes `Book` and `Borrower`, but there is no overall library class which violates the requirements.  The application of OOP principles is weak.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
* No inheritance is used.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* No polymorphism is demonstrated.

**2.4 Encapsulation (4/2)**
*  Fields are appropriately encapsulated using private modifiers and getters/setters in the `Book` class.


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2):**
* `try-catch` blocks are used effectively in the main method and within several library methods for handling potential `LibraryException`.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2):**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used correctly for error handling.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1):**
* No specific handling for edge cases like invalid IDs or inputs is implemented.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* Data is correctly saved using `ObjectOutputStream`.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):**
* Data is correctly loaded using `ObjectInputStream`, handling file absence gracefully.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
* No additional robustness measures are implemented (e.g., error handling during file I/O operations).


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):**
* Algorithms used are reasonably efficient for the given problem size.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):**
* Naming conventions are mostly followed, with some minor inconsistencies.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):**
* Code is well-formatted with consistent indentation and readability.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of basic Java concepts and object-oriented programming, implementing core functionalities effectively. However, the program lacks crucial features like input validation, error handling for various edge cases, and enforcement of borrowing limits.  Improved use of OOP principles and a more robust file handling strategy are necessary to enhance the program's quality and functionality.  Consider adding more comprehensive error handling and incorporating features for a richer user experience.
