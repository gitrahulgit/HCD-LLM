## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 35/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (20/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (7/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the functionality to add books.  Input validation and duplicate prevention were not implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):**  The student did not implement the functionality to display only available books. The code displays all books regardless of their availability status.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (3/3):**  The student did not implement book update functionality; however, the `addBook` method works correctly.  

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the functionality to register borrowers.  Duplicate ID prevention is not implemented.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):**  The student implemented the functionality to view the borrower's history, displaying the list of books borrowed, but not those returned.  

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (4/5):** The student implemented the borrowing functionality, correctly updating borrower and book records. However, there's no check for the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The return functionality works correctly, updating borrower records.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (4/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (2/3)**
* The student used classes `Book` and `Borrower`, demonstrating understanding of object modeling, but class design can be improved.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
* The student did not use inheritance in their solution.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* The student did not demonstrate polymorphism.

**2.4 Encapsulation (2/2)**
* The student used private fields and getter methods for the `Book` class, demonstrating basic encapsulation.

#### **3. Exception Handling (3/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2):**
* Try-catch blocks are used to handle potential exceptions during file I/O.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (1/2):**
* A custom `LibraryException` class was defined and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1):**
* The code does not explicitly handle edge cases, such as invalid inputs.

#### **4. File I/O Implementation (3/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* The student implemented saving data using `ObjectOutputStream`, correctly saving to files.

**4.2 Load Data (1/2):**
* The student implemented data loading with `ObjectInputStream`.  Error handling for file absence is partially implemented.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
* No explicit handling of potential issues such as corrupted files.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):**
* Algorithms used are generally efficient for the task, with room for improvement in data structure choice.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):**
* Mostly adheres to Java naming conventions but can be improved.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):**
* Code is well-formatted and easy to read.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrated a good understanding of the core concepts of object-oriented programming and file I/O. The implementation of the file saving and loading mechanisms was good. Areas for improvement include implementing checks for borrowing limits, handling edge cases more thoroughly, including error handling for file corruption, adding book availability checks, and implementing inheritance and polymorphism to enhance the code's structure and maintainability.  Using more robust input validation would improve the system's overall reliability.
