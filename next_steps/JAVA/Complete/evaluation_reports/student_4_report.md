## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (10/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (4/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (0/4):** The student's code lacks the implementation for adding a book.  No functionality to add a book exists.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):**  No functionality to display books exists.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):**  No functionality to update book details exists.

**1.2 Borrower Management (3/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (3/4):** The `registerBorrower` method is implemented, allowing the addition of borrowers.  However, duplicate ID prevention is not implemented.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):** There is no functionality to view a borrower's history.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (3/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (2/5):** The `borrowBook` method partially works; it updates the book's availability but lacks critical checks for borrower existence and the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (1/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles the return of a book, including exception handling for the book not being borrowed by the user.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (0/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (0/3)**
* The code uses classes, but the modeling is rudimentary and lacks proper encapsulation and methods for core functionalities.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
* No inheritance is used in the student's submission.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* No polymorphism is demonstrated.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
* Data fields are not well encapsulated; there are no getters or setters for the Book class.  


#### **3. Exception Handling (5/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2)**
* `try-catch` blocks are used to handle `LibraryException`.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (1/1)**
*  The `returnBook` method handles the edge case of a book not being borrowed by a user.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (0/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (0/2)**
* No file I/O functionality is implemented.

**4.2 Load Data (0/2)**
* No file I/O functionality is implemented.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1)**
* No file I/O implemented, therefore no file handling robustness to assess.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (0/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (0/3)**
*  The current implementation uses basic data structures, but lacks necessary functionality and efficiency for a larger scale library system.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (0/2)**
* Minor issues with naming conventions exist.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5)**
* The code is generally well-formatted and readable.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a basic understanding of exception handling and creating classes. However, the core functionality of the library system is largely missing.  Focus on completing the missing methods for adding books, displaying books, handling borrowing limits, and implementing file I/O.  Improve class design using encapsulation and consider using more suitable data structures for better efficiency.
