**Overall Marks:** 5/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (0/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (0/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (0/4):** The student's submission did not implement any book management functionality.  No books can be added.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):**  No functionality to display books was implemented.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):** No functionality to update book details was implemented.

**1.2 Borrower Management (0/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (0/4):** No borrower registration functionality was implemented.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):** No functionality to view borrower history was implemented.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (0/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (0/5):** No book borrowing functionality was implemented.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (0/3):** No book return functionality was implemented.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (0/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (0/3)**
* The submission lacks any classes or objects related to the library management system.  No attempt was made to model the system using OOP.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
* No inheritance was used in the provided code.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* No polymorphism was demonstrated.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
* No encapsulation was evident in the submitted code.


#### **3. Exception Handling (0/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (0/2)**
* No `try-catch` blocks were implemented to handle exceptions.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (0/2)**
* No custom exception class was created.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* No edge case handling was implemented.

#### **4. File I/O Implementation (0/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (0/2)**
* No data saving functionality was implemented.

**4.2 Load Data (0/2)**
* No data loading functionality was implemented.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1)**
* File handling robustness was not addressed as no file handling was implemented.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (0/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (0/3)**
* No algorithms were implemented, so efficiency cannot be assessed.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (0/2)**
* While the submission is very minimal, the `LibraryApp` class name does adhere to Java naming conventions.  However, this is not sufficient for marks.

#### **6. Code Formatting (0/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (0/5)**
* The single line of code is readable.  However, this is not enough to earn any marks.

**Feedback:**
The submission only contains a single line of code that prints "Hello World!".  This indicates a significant lack of understanding of the project requirements and the core concepts of Java programming. To improve, start by studying the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, file I/O, and exception handling in Java.  Then, break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (like book management, borrower management, etc.) and tackle each part individually before combining them.  The model solution provided can serve as a useful guide.
