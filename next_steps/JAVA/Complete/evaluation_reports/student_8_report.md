## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 28/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (15/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (7/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, allowing for the addition of new books with all required fields.  No input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):** The `updateBook` method is implemented, but it lacks proper validation of the bookId and only allows updating the title, author, and genre.  Availability update is absent.

**1.2 Borrower Management (0/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (0/4):** This functionality is missing entirely.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):**  This functionality is missing entirely.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (8/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (0/5):** This functionality is missing entirely.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (0/3):** This functionality is missing entirely.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (3/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (2/3)**
* The student uses classes (`Book`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects appropriately to represent books and manage them within the library system.  However, a more comprehensive class structure could improve the design.

**2.2 Inheritance (1/3)**
* The student demonstrates basic inheritance with `LibraryEntity` as a base class for `Book`. However, the inheritance isn't fully utilized to its potential, and could be further extended for other library entities.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* Polymorphism is not demonstrated in the provided code.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
* Encapsulation is partially implemented. Fields in the `Book` class are private, but getters and setters are not used consistently.


#### **3. Exception Handling (3/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (1/2)**
* A `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions during file operations but not other potential exceptions.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is correctly implemented and used.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* Edge case handling is minimal.  No explicit handling for invalid inputs or missing data is present.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (3/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):**
* The `saveData` method correctly saves the `books` data to a file.

**4.2 Load Data (1/2):**
* The `loadData` method correctly loads data if the file exists.  Error handling for missing files is minimal.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
* The solution lacks robustness;  no check for file corruption or other potential issues is included.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):**
* The algorithms used are generally efficient, but they could be further optimized.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):**
* The student generally adheres to Java naming conventions but could improve consistency.


#### **6. Code Formatting (4/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (4/5):**
* The code is generally readable, with consistent indentation. Minor improvements could be made for better clarity.

**Feedback:**
The submission demonstrates a basic understanding of object-oriented programming and file handling in Java. The implementation of book management features is partially complete, but significant functionality related to borrowers and transactions is missing.  Focus on implementing the remaining features and improving error handling and input validation to enhance the system's robustness.  Consider exploring more advanced OOP concepts such as polymorphism and interfaces for a more elegant design.
