## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 40/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (22/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (9/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, allowing for the addition of books with all required fields.  No apparent input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):** The `updateBook` method allows for the modification of existing book details; however, it lacks input validation for the Book ID.

**1.2 Borrower Management (6/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers and prevents duplicate IDs.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (2/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method displays the borrowed books; however, it does not show returned books.


**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records, and validating constraints such as book availability and borrowing limits.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method handles return operations and updates borrower records.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (8/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (3/3)**
The student used appropriate classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`) and objects to represent entities and manage their state.

**2.2 Inheritance (3/3)**
Effective use of inheritance is demonstrated using a base class (`LibraryEntity`) for common attributes and derived classes for specialization (`Book`, `Borrower`).

**2.3 Polymorphism (1/2)**
Polymorphism is partially demonstrated through method overriding (`toString()`).  Method overloading is absent.

**2.4 Encapsulation (1/2)**
The student uses private fields but omits getter methods for some attributes in the `Book` class.  Setters are inconsistently used.


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2):**  Appropriate `try-catch` blocks are used to handle runtime exceptions.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2):** A custom exception class (`LibraryException`) is created and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1):**  Edge cases like invalid Book or Borrower IDs and non-numeric inputs are not explicitly handled.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (4/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (2/2):** The `saveData` method correctly saves data to files.

**4.2 Load Data (2/2):**  The `loadData` method correctly loads data from files.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**  Error handling for file I/O exceptions could be improved.  No explicit checks for missing files are present.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):** Algorithms are generally efficient, but there's room for improvement in terms of optimizing data structures and avoiding unnecessary iterations for certain operations.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):** Mostly adheres to Java naming conventions, though some improvements are needed for greater consistency.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):** Code is generally well-formatted and readable with consistent indentation.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of core Java concepts and OOP principles, implementing the majority of the required functionalities.  Strengths include the use of inheritance, exception handling, and file I/O.  Areas for improvement include adding input validation, enhancing error handling for edge cases, adding getter methods for all attributes, and improving documentation.  Consider improving the robustness of file handling to account for missing or corrupted files.
