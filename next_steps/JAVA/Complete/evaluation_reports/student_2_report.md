## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 30/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (18/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (7/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, adding books with all required fields.  No input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method correctly retrieves and displays available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (0/3):** The `updateBook` method was implemented, but it lacks functionality to update book details.  The method only checks for the existence of a book ID.


**1.2 Borrower Management (4/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers with all required fields. No duplicate ID prevention is present.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (0/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method was implemented but does not correctly display the borrowing history for a borrower.  It only returns the Borrower object.


**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly handles borrowing operations, updating availability and borrower records.  The borrowing limit is enforced.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles return operations and updates records.  However, error handling for invalid book IDs is insufficient.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (0/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (0/3)**
* The student used classes (`Book`, `Borrower`, `LibrarySystem`), but did not effectively model the system using OOP principles.  There is a lack of meaningful interaction between the objects.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
* No inheritance is used in the student's code.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* No polymorphism is demonstrated in the student's code.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
* While the student uses private fields, getters and setters are only partially implemented and aren't consistently used.


#### **3. Exception Handling (3/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (1/2)**
* Try-catch blocks are used in a few methods to handle some exceptions, but the handling is not comprehensive.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2):**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used effectively.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1):**
* Edge cases, such as invalid inputs or book unavailability, are not thoroughly handled.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (0/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (0/2):**
* The `saveData` method is empty and does not save data to files.

**4.2 Load Data (0/2):**
* The `loadData` method is empty and does not load data from files.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):**
* There is no file handling, so robustness cannot be assessed.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (4/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):**
* Algorithms for searching books and borrowers are inefficient, using linear searches.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (2/2):**
* The student mostly adheres to Java naming conventions.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):**
* Code readability and indentation are good.

**Feedback:**
The code demonstrates a basic understanding of the Library Management System requirements.  The implementation of core functionalities, such as borrowing and returning books, is partially successful.  However,  critical aspects like data persistence (file I/O), exception handling, and the application of object-oriented principles need significant improvement.  Focus on implementing missing features and fully utilizing OOP concepts for a more robust and maintainable system.
