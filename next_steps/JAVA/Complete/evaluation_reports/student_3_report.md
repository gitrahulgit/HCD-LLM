## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 20/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (10/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (4/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (2/4):** The student implemented the `addBook` method, but input validation and duplicate prevention are missing.  The `addBook` method only adds a book without checking if a book with the same ID already exists.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (0/3):** This functionality is not implemented.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (2/3):**  Not implemented.  Partial marks awarded for the `setAvailable` method in the `Book` class, demonstrating some understanding of updating book details.


**1.2 Borrower Management (3/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (2/4):** The `Borrower` class is correctly implemented, but there is no method to register a borrower in the Library System.  Duplicate ID prevention is not implemented.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (1/3):**  This functionality is not implemented, but partial credit is given for the existence of the `getBorrowedBooks` method within the `Borrower` class.


**1.3 Transaction Handling (3/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (0/5):** This functionality is missing entirely.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (3/3):** The `returnBook` method in the `Borrower` class is correctly implemented, handling the exception if the book is not found in the borrower's history.

#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (3/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (2/3)**
* The student created `Book` and `Borrower` classes, demonstrating some understanding of using classes.  However, the overall class structure and interactions are incomplete.

**2.2 Inheritance (1/3)**
* The `LibraryEntity` abstract class is partially implemented. While it shows an attempt at inheritance, itâ€™s not fully utilized or integrated into the system's functionality.

**2.3 Polymorphism (0/2)**
* No polymorphism demonstrated.

**2.4 Encapsulation (0/2)**
*  Fields are not declared as private and no getters/setters were implemented.

#### **3. Exception Handling (2/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (0/2)**
* No `try-catch` blocks are used.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2)**
* A custom `LibraryException` class is defined and used, demonstrating an understanding of custom exception handling.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1)**
* No edge cases handled.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (0/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (0/2)**
* No file I/O implementation.

**4.2 Load Data (0/2)**
* No file I/O implementation.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1)**
* No file I/O implementation.

#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (2/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (1/3)**
* Algorithms are not efficient; no algorithms implemented for book and borrower management or data handling.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2)**
*  Naming conventions are partially followed. Some inconsistencies exist.


#### **6. Code Formatting (3/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (3/5)**
* Indentation is inconsistent in places, but the code remains generally readable.

**Feedback:**
The submission demonstrates a basic understanding of class creation and exception handling, evident in the `LibraryException` class and some class definitions. However, the core functionality of the Library Management System is significantly incomplete.  Focus on completing the core functionalities, particularly transaction handling and file I/O.  Implement input validation and error handling to make the system more robust.  Improve code organization and adhere strictly to Java naming conventions.
