## Library Management System - Student Submission Evaluation

**Overall Marks:** 35/50

---

**Detailed Report:**

#### **1. Implementation of Core Functionalities (20/25)**
This section evaluates the correct implementation of the key requirements.

**1.1 Book Management (8/10)**
* **1.1.1 Add a Book (4/4):** The student correctly implemented the `addBook` method, adding books with all required fields.  No input validation or duplicate prevention was implemented.
* **1.1.2 Display Available Books (3/3):** The `displayAvailableBooks` method accurately retrieves and displays available books.
* **1.1.3 Update Book Details (1/3):**  Updating book details is not implemented.

**1.2 Borrower Management (5/7)**
* **1.2.1 Register Borrower (4/4):** The `registerBorrower` method correctly adds borrowers, preventing duplicate IDs is not implemented.
* **1.2.2 View Borrower History (1/3):** The `viewBorrowerHistory` method displays borrowed books but doesn't handle returned books.

**1.3 Transaction Handling (7/8)**
* **1.3.1 Borrow Book (5/5):** The `borrowBook` method correctly updates availability and borrower records, including handling the borrowing limit.
* **1.3.2 Return Book (2/3):** The `returnBook` method correctly handles returns and updates records.  However, error handling for non-existent books is missing.


#### **2. Use of OOP Principles (6/10)**
This section evaluates adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

**2.1 Classes and Objects (2/3)**
The student used classes `Book` and `Borrower` appropriately to represent entities.  However, a more robust `Library` class to manage interactions would have improved the design.

**2.2 Inheritance (0/3)**
No inheritance is used in the student's solution.

**2.3 Polymorphism (2/2)**
The `toString()` method is overridden in both `Book` and `Borrower` classes, demonstrating polymorphism.

**2.4 Encapsulation (2/2)**
Private fields are used with appropriate getters and setters for `Book` and `Borrower`.


#### **3. Exception Handling (4/5)**
This section evaluates the robustness of the program in handling errors gracefully.

**3.1 Use of Try-Catch Blocks (2/2):**  `try-catch` blocks are used effectively in several methods.

**3.2 Custom Exception Class (2/2):** A custom `LibraryException` class is created and used appropriately.

**3.3 Edge Case Handling (0/1):**  Edge case handling for invalid inputs is missing.


#### **4. File I/O Implementation (2/5)**
This section evaluates the ability to persist and retrieve data using file handling.

**4.1 Save Data (1/2):**  The `saveData` method saves data to files, but the format is simplistic and lacks error handling.

**4.2 Load Data (1/2):** The `loadData` method attempts to load data but the implementation is incomplete.

**4.3 File Handling Robustness (0/1):** File handling lacks robustness; error handling for missing or corrupted files is missing.


#### **5. Code Efficiency and Quality (3/5)**
This section evaluates the overall efficiency, maintainability, and quality of the code.

**5.1 Efficient Algorithms (2/3):** Algorithms are generally efficient, though improvements could be made in searching for books and borrowers.

**5.2 Adherence to Java Naming Conventions (1/2):**  Java naming conventions are mostly followed, but minor inconsistencies exist.


#### **6. Code Formatting (5/5)**
This section evaluates clarity, maintainability, and presentation of the code.

**6.1 Code Readability and Indentation (5/5):** Code is well-formatted and easy to read with consistent indentation.

**Feedback:**
The student demonstrates a good understanding of object-oriented programming and exception handling. The core functionalities are partially implemented, but file I/O and data persistence need significant improvement.  Adding input validation and improving the data persistence mechanism would greatly enhance the program's robustness.  Consider using more structured data storage like JSON or XML for better file handling.
